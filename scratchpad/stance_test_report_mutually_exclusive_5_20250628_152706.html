2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category.

During the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union, dogma was imposed from the top down, much like the anti-DEI dogma that is erasing language and jobs in the US lately. Or the vaccine &quot;skepticism&quot; that will maim and kill Americans in the the coming years. 

The damage to the Soviet Union from this sort of dogma included fallout from Lysenko&#039;s trivially disproven theories that suppressed the study of genetics and wasted resources and lives in the pursuit of nonsense.

Scientists and meteorologists and indeed ALL civil servants should be able to speak the truth, even when it goes against the Executive&#039;s policies.

The proposal erodes the merit-based foundation of the federal hiring system by allowing subjective reclassification of roles, which will lead to favoritism and politicized hiring. It opens the door for the federal workforce to be influenced by partisan loyalty rather than professional qualifications and ethical conduct.  The impartiality of government agencies is critical to public trust. A workforce vulnerable to political purges risks undermining that trust. Career civil servants possess deep expertise and historical understanding. Removing them for political reasons threatens the continuity and efficiency of government operations. The rule’s definitions of “policy-influencing” roles are too expansive and would be applied to positions that are operational or technical rather than policy-driven. By allowing the executive branch to reclassify and terminate employees at will, this rule dangerously consolidates power and reduces essential institutional checks.

This proposal threatens the foundational principles of a nonpartisan, expert-driven civil service and endangers the integrity of federal grantmaking—particularly within scientific agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The proposed rule&#039;s language explicitly targets individuals involved in discretionary aspects of grantmaking, including drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating applications, and selecting recipients. These tasks require deep scientific expertise, rigorous peer review, and adherence to evidence-based standards—not political alignment. Reclassifying these roles as political appointments will severely undermine the objectivity and credibility of federal funding decisions.
Of particular concern is the reported plan to make all NIH Institute and Center Directors political appointees. This would dismantle long-term planning and erode public trust in the NIH, which has historically functioned as an independent, world-leading scientific institution. Scientific discovery and public health innovation require stability, continuity, and freedom from political influence. Replacing career scientists with politically motivated appointees will cause irreparable harm to our research infrastructure and international leadership.

This proposed regulation, Schedule F, under Docket ID OPM-2025-0004” and RIN 3206-AO80, raises profound concerns about the future of the Civil Service and its foundational principles. I strongly oppose the proposed move to reclassify all management officials from the competitive service to the excepted service, effectively making them fire-able at will. This shift represents a dangerous step backward towards a spoils system of patronage, undermining the merit-based principles that have long been the bedrock of a nonpartisan and professional public service.

The implications for a functioning democracy are deeply troubling. Replacing a system that prioritizes expertise and neutral competence with one susceptible to political favoritism would erode the stability and effectiveness of government agencies. Subjecting management officials to the constant threat of dismissal based on political allegiance, rather than performance, would inevitably lead to a chilling effect on their ability to provide candid and objective advice, potentially compromising the integrity of policy-making and implementation.

Furthermore, this proposed regulation appears to directly contravene the spirit and potentially the letter of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).

I strongly oppose any effort to implement or reinstate the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal represents an alarming threat to the foundations of the merit-based civil service system—an institution that has safeguarded the competence, impartiality, and integrity of the federal workforce for over 140 years.

Schedule F would dangerously erode the core protections established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to dismantle the corrupt spoils system and ensure that federal hiring and employment decisions are based on merit, not political loyalty. By allowing broad categories of career civil servants—especially those involved in policy development or analysis—to be reclassified and dismissed without cause, Schedule F invites the very abuses the Pendleton Act was designed to prevent.

This proposal is directly at odds with the statutory merit system principles laid out in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b), which guarantee that federal employment should be based on merit and free from political coercion. It also undermines the due process protections in 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which safeguard against arbitrary or retaliatory removals by requiring just cause and fair procedures. Stripping thousands of career officials of these protections not only threatens their job security—it endangers the government’s ability to function based on facts, expertise, and continuity.

Moreover, Schedule F would have a ch... [truncated]">Request Access

The focus on the potential for rogue employees mentioned in the proposal is a red herring meant to distract people from the real focus - installing politically aligned players into key positions. This only furthers the opportunity for corruption in our government operations because of the risk that the Executive will fill these positions with unqualified political appointees whose primary qualification is loyalty to the Executive. This threatens the capacity of these departments to serve citizens, as well as the quality of the work products. In addition, it becomes a revolving door, because as soon as another political leaning takes office, these appointed individuals will likely be removed, using the same justification. This can&#039;t be an efficient long term method of government operations. 

Furthermore, the Executive intends to exclude our elected representatives in Congress who established the regulations to insure that the knowledge and experience of qualified public servants can freely serve without fear of political retribution.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.

RIN 3206-A080

I worked in the NPS from 1973 until I retired in 2006 as a seasonal in four parks and a career employee in three. The great majority of my fellow employees were competent and effective with an enormous love and attachment to the incredible cultural and natural resources of this country. The employees who chose to work for the NPS were not in it for the salary but were motivated to protect these resources and to share them with the American people.

The very basis for this rule is insulting to myself and to all my fellow NPS, indeed all Federal workers, who spent their entire careers in service to the American people and this country.

With that stated, I strongly oppose the implementation of Schedule Policy/Career. 

Overall, the proposed rule is vague and wide sweeping in its attempt to move Civil Service positions to &quot;at will&quot; positions. Loyalty should be to the Constitution and the American people, not to a political party or an individual. Non-partisan employees and experts ensure that the spoils system, that was rampant in the Federal workforce 
in the 1880s, does not return. That was the purpose of Merit Protection. This rule, in effect, returns us to that time. Why is this necessary? 

My comments are in the attached document. I look forward to detailed responses from OPM regarding the questions I have raised and to clarify and define. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This policy would represent an unprecedented increase in the politicization of the federal workforce, threatening the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service. I myself work on regulations and guidance, but my work involves input by numerous experts (scientific, policy, legal, etc) who respectfully discuss and agree/disagree with one another to write well reasoned documents. Other departments and agencies can also provide review and edits. Then the public and other stakeholders (including the White House and OMB) are allowed to provide their input through the notice and comment process. Rule making and guidance writing and other policy making efforts are civil service work, not that of political roles. 

This work is grounded in evidence, guided by public health priorities, and intended to serve everyone—regardless of political affiliation. The ability to carry out this mission depends on a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service that values expertise and insulates scientific integrity from political pressures.

A professional, non-partisan civil service is essential to having a well-managed, efficient and effective government. This merit-based system ensures that taxpayers are able to get the information, services and support that they need to do business, pay taxes and fees and to grow the economy.

To undercut this system is to hamstring growth, efficiency and capacity in a way that will damage the future prosperity of the US and its citizenry for no good or well-considered reason.

I ask that you vote in opposition to this bill as it is antithetical to a healthy and functioning government.">
