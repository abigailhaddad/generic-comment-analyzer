Vaccine Access

I have an autoimmune disease and am a teacher in a public school. I am around kids and people all day every day. I depend on vaccines to help my immune system fight off infectious diseases more easily allowing me the ability to stay in school, do my job and be there for the kids I teach. It is my choice to get my annual vaccines- I trust them because they are backed by science, rigorous testing. I understand the science behind how they were developed and how they function in the body. Do not take away my right to choose to protect myself and those in my community from infectious diseases. 

The CDC’s ACIP is a vital part of the safety and efficacy of vaccines. I am appalled that someone like RFK Jr. , someone that has no qualifications to be in his position, was able to dismiss all members of the ACIP and replace them with bias, unqualified people putting the American public at risk. I am asking for the following to be done: 

	1.	RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
	2.	Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
	3.	ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
	4.	ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
	5.	ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.
