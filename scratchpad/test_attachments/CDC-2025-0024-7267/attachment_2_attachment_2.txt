Pregnancy seems to be a risk factor for severe disease with COVID-19. Although 
SARS-CoV-2 intrauterine transmission seems to be rare, most studies show 
COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk for pregnancy complications, with 
higher risk among those with severe disease compared with those mildly affected. 
Studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and 
effective. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 have been found in umbilical cord blood and 
breast milk following maternal vaccination, which might provide protection to 
the infant. However, vaccination rates during pregnancy remain low. Studies are 
needed to understand ways to address SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant 
persons.
