The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant medical, 
social, and economic impacts globally, both in the short and long term. Although 
most individuals recover within a few days or weeks from an acute infection, 
some experience longer lasting effects. Data regarding the postacute sequelae of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC) in children, or 
long COVID, are only just emerging in the literature. These symptoms and 
conditions may reflect persistent symptoms from acute infection (eg, cough, 
headaches, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell), new symptoms like dizziness, 
or exacerbation of underlying conditions. Children may develop conditions de 
novo, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, myalgic 
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune conditions and 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. This state-of-the-art narrative 
review provides a summary of our current knowledge about PASC in children, 
including prevalence, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, 
underlying mechanisms, and functional outcomes, as well as a conceptual 
framework for PASC based on the current National Institutes of Health 
definition. We highlight the pediatric components of the National Institutes of 
Health-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, which seeks to 
characterize the natural history, mechanisms, and long-term health effects of 
PASC in children and young adults to inform future treatment and prevention 
efforts. These initiatives include electronic health record cohorts, which offer 
rapid assessments at scale with geographical and demographic diversity, as well 
as longitudinal prospective observational cohorts, to estimate disease burden, 
illness trajectory, pathobiology, and clinical manifestations and outcomes.
