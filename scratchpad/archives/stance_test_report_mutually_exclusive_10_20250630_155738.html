COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective; the scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease, including disability and death, for people of all ages.

Vaccine rates are already low and communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

In addition, several of our closest friends worked as nurses, and specialists in the emergency department of a local hospital during these first waves of the virus. Their story did not waiver; those with the vaccine had much  better outcomes than those who did not. One of our friends, an experienced emergency room nurse, retired earlier than planned due to the psychological stress, watching people, placed face down,   trying to breathe, then ending up on ventilators if they were lucky enough to have one available. He told us how unvaccinated people, had regrets regarding not getting vaccinated nearing the end of their fight, and of their deaths from Covid. 
The Vaccine availability was a blessing. Vaccines made it safer for us as a family to work in our chosen fields, with the general public, and help others. I believe strongly that vaccines are safe, need to be recommended by the ACIP and kept widely available for those who want them.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I am healthy today and my grandchildren are alive and well today because of vaccines. I am old enough to remember neighbors who had children with polio. The whole family was harmed and the person with polio led a restricted life that was cut short with complications.     Before the changes RFK has made to our health system,  we were the envy of the world.  I taught students aiming for medical school and medical research. They wanted to use science to objectively find answers to problems.  They expected to have to prove that a possible treatment actually worked, using statistics and review by several independent evaluators. RFK has eliminated that trusted method of using science.  In the upcoming meeting, please follow these necessary steps to restore what we might lose forever,  and protect people. 
1. Make COVID updates available to all.  I taught the subject of viral change through time and know how fast viruses can change, making older vaccines ineffective.   I have have COVID twice with only moderate symptoms, and there is solid science that I am among the many thousands , many of us ove 80 like me,  that recovered quickly because I had the latest vaccine.

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. I acquired Long COVID as a result of a COVID infection, which currently threatens my ability to work due to impairments in my short term memory and cognitive processing ability. As a new university graduate, I shouldn&#039;t have to be in the position of losing a career that&#039;s barely started - it is both a waste of my potential and that of US institutions&#039; resources to limit access to vaccines from a monetary and moral standpoint. My personal experience is not a one-off... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

As someone who was disabled due to COVID, I am horrified that others can’t be protected from further serious infection. Please reverse course. 

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular acce... [truncated]">To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee. Children in 2025 SHOULD NOT die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. We ask you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.

    Any changes to vaccine-related policies requires a science and evidence-... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

The Secretary of Health and Human Services has recently implemented changes at FDA and CDC - including reconstitution of the ACIP in particular - to circumvent independent decision processes and the counsel of expert advisors that without a doubt would support the conclusion that COVID vaccines are safe, effective, and profoundly beneficial to public health. Beyond the immediate policy decision at hand, this represents a grave threat to America&#039;s public health expertise and thus the health of all Americans. It must be vigorously opposed.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am 32, but my father is in his 70s. I am his sole caretaker. If I cannot access vaccines like the covid and flu vaccine, I am putting him and other higher risk people in my life at risk. It is patently irresponsible and unhinged that we are letting somebody who believes in miasma theory govern decisions about infectious disease guidance. We know that breaking the chain of transmission substantially benefits everyone. Limiting who gets vaccines is profoundly harmful. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID.

In addition,  I believe that equally important is the principle that citizens must retain the right to make informed decisions about their health and well-being and the government should respect that choice and  should not override an individual’s freedom to choose preventative care. Restricting or removing access to that choice undermines the values of personal autonomy and well-being.
And last but not least, ensuring access to vaccines is not only a matter of personal health but of public health and well-being. 

Thank you for considering this perspective.">Dear Committee Members,

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

This issue is deeply personal to me. I have immunocompromised family members who rely on the people around them being vaccinated to reduce their exposure risk. I get vaccinated not only for myself but to protect them—an extra layer of defense that could be life-saving. As a working parent, I also carry the responsibility of providing care a...

BOTH of my perfectly healthy children were damaged by the hepatitis B vaccines within six months of receiving their last booster. I actually spoke with Bonnie Dunbar, one of the vaccine developers for Merck on many occasions. She appeared before Congress and on 60 Minutes, trying to warn the world of what had happened and what will be happening if mRNA vaccines are allowed to be developed. Bonnie lost her job, every penny she ever made, and is now working with under privileged impoverished children in Africa. This was a travesty against a magnificent woman who was only telling the truth and presenting facts. Sh... [truncated]">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...
