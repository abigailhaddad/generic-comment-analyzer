Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Although I am using parts of a template to write to this committee, I want to tell you that as a business owner I am alarmed and distressed by the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

As a business owner I am also horrified that RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. My business was severely impact... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

My name is Lane Ilstrup and I&#039;m a young adult living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since birth I have benefited from public infrastructure granting me the right to vaccines that prevent infectious disease. This was lifesaving always, and especially since 2020 with the onset of COVID-19 it was regular access to vaccines and boosters without cost that allowed me any protection against COVID. Since then I contracted COVID-19 once and it was my regular vaccinations that allowed me to survive it as an immunocompromised adult. So, this issue is deeply personal to me individually and to me as a member of our society - today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such a...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I am a public and population health nurse, having worked on the front lines for over 40 years and believe I have an ethical obligation to speak out about the most recent announcement about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low. I know this not only from my experience having worked alongside populations who suffered extreme illness and disabilities because of misinformation and disinformation that prevented them from vaccinating their children. Do you know what it is like to watch a 5 week old newborn cough and cough because they were exposed to whooping cough from unvaccinated people around them, which requires not only an expensive pediatric intensive care stay in the hospital, but weeks thereafter in the home setting (if they survive)!  Our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Child... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

The FDA must ensure a four-week public comment period before an upcoming committee meeting. One week prior is not enough time for—and effectively preventing—public feedback.

As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence clearly indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important tools for addressing SARS-CoV-2. Universal access to updated COVID vaccines is needed to address the ongoing changes in variants. Additionally, vaccines must be recommended for individuals of all ages and be fully covered by public funds/or insurance at a regular interval of at least every six months.

The vaccine schedule should address waning efficacy in the months following vaccination [1-3] as well as the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains. FDA decisions will affect the current and future vaccine approach, including what healthcare providers recommend, what health insurance covers, and level of public engagement.

Restricting access to these vaccinations, at any level, neglects the responsibility to protect everyone, as anyone is vulnerable to a COVID infection that could lead to severe health outcomes or Long COVID. Given that there is the potential to upda... [truncated]">Docket No. FDA-2025-N-1146

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people. 
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with f... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I believe from our experience to date, we can all agree that the current vaccines are at best, therapeutics. That being said, they have in their ineffective ways, saved millions of lives and billions of healthcare related costs.

 

While the WHO, CEPI, Covax and other are pushing to make vaccines available to all underdeveloped areas of the world, I do not believe sending current vaccines will assist. The current state of the USA and other developed countries prove that what we have right now cannot control this pandemic.

 

As we continue to search for the pan corona vaccine, numerous papers have been written that appear to agree that mucosal immunity is necessary to not only protect, but to stop shedding.

 

As SARS-CoV-2 initially infects the upper respiratory tract, its first interactions with the immune system must occur predominantly at the respiratory mucosal surfaces,

I need covid vaccines, and my community does too! I&#039;m high-risk for long covid, and having access to these vaccines (and most other people having access to them, too) allows me to take part in life in my community. The fewer vaccinated people, the more spread -- and all of us are just a few additional infections away from long covid, including a lifetime of significant disability.">* RFK Jr. MUST preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.
* Members of ACIP MUST disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?
