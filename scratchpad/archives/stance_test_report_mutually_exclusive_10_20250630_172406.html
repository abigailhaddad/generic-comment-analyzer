The measles outbreak in Texas is a reminder that a disease which had been officially eliminated from the USA (in 2020) can and will return if people are persuaded they should not get their children vaccinated. 
Our grandson Michael is an engaging, cheerful and very active 3-year-old boy. Apparently vigorous and healthy at delivery, he shortly descended into a coma due to a rare genetic metabolic disorder. Most male babies with this disorder die, but Michael was quickly transferred from the local ER to Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, OR, where they recognized the disorder and stabilized him. At 6 months he received a liver transplant and started to thrive. 
Michael is a survivor! This year he’s been allowed to socialize with other children and attend a preschool to catch up on social development. However, his anti-rejection drugs leave him vulnerable to illnesses around him. Since he catches every cold and virus present at preschool, I am terrified to think of him attending school with unvaccinated children. 
My recommendation is that we acknowledge proven methods to protect all of our children. If we put them in harm’s way simply to w...

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?
