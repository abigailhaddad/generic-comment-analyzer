ACIP Members,

You have a monumental responsibility to us (the public) to make sure vaccines are truly safe.  The previous committee did not pay attention to the numerous alarming safety signals coming out of VAERS concerning the COVID vaccines.  I beg you to please look at the VAERS data (as well as the V-Safe data) and remove all currently licensed COVID vaccines off the market, at least until that data has been thoroughly reviewed and studied.

I&#039;m also requesting that you require all vaccines be subject to double-blind inert placebo studies prior to licensing, just as the rest of pharmaceuticals are.  The weak studies that have been done on vaccines in years past (particularly those on the childhood schedule) have only been studied against other vaccines.  This is a sorely inadequate practice in which to gauge safety.  At the very least, please look at existing HMO data for both vaccinated and unvaccinated children and compare the instances of chronic diseases, allergies, ADHD, autism, death, etc. to determine if there are any safety signals.  If you truly believe in the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule, you have nothing to lose by doing this study.

I can only imagine that each of you originally studied medicine and science with a goal of helping people and making things better for people.  Please remember why you got into this profession in the first place and resist the temptation of the money and power offered ... [truncated]">ACIP – Please look at the safety signals in VAERS

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID ...

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
The COVID-19 pandemic left every human on Earth feeling vulnerable. For those of us who want to protect ourselves and loved ones, that means doing the work to understand this new virus and everything else about the world that changed because of it. When the world opened back up after the majority of folks were vaccinated, a lot of people thought that we had defeated the pandemic. We soon learned that the pandemic was not over, but the virus mutated and vaccine protection waned in response. As we continued to discover more and more, we learned that vaccines were helpful, not harmful, and were a baseline in a multi-layer defense against the virus from destroying our families and disabling many people in the long term.

The
 
COVID-19

left
 
every
 
human
 
on

feeling
 
vulnerable.
 
For
 
those
 
of
 
us
 
who
 
want
 
to
 
protect
 
ourselves
 
and
 
loved
 
ones,
 
that
 
means
 
doing
 
the

this
 
new
 
virus
 
and
 
everything
 
else
 
about
 
the

that
 
changed
 
because
 
of
 
it.
 
When
 
the

opened
 
back
 
up
 
after
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
folks
 
were
 
vaccinated,
 
a

people
 
thought
 
that
 
we
 
had
 
defeated
 
the

We
 
soon
 
learned
 
that
 
the
 
pandemic
 
was
 
not
 
over,
 
but
 
the
 
virus
 
mutated
 
and
 
vaccine
 
protection
 
waned
 
in
 
response.
 
As
 
we
 
continued
 
to
 
discover
 
more
 
and
 
more,
 
we
 
learned
 
that
 
vaccines
 
were
 
helpful,
 
not
 
harmful,
 
and
 
were
 
a
 
baseline
 
in
 
a
 
multi-layer

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. My wife is currently pregnant with twins and making vaccines seem &quot;dangerous&quot; is harmful to their health and makes it much harder to convince their grandparents to get vaccines to protect their health. 

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vacci... [truncated]">To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

COVID-19 is not a mild illness. It continues to severely impact disabled, chronically ill, and immunocompromised people, who have often been excluded from policy conversations and protections. But beyond that, COVID-19 is also a mass disabling event. It has caused millions of new disabilities, including through Long COVID, neurological injury, and cardiovascular damage—often in people who were previous able-bodied and healthy.

Denying or restricting access to vaccines, whether by age cutoff, insurance status, or cost barriers, not only endangers those already at high risk, it actively contributes to the growth of the disabled population. This is not theoretical. It is happening now, and the numbers are growing. 

Public health policy must recognize that disabled lives matter, that our communities are not disposable, and that preventing new disability through vaccination is an urgent moral and political obligation.

I respectfully urge ACIP to:
	•	Ensure ongoing, free access to COVID-19 vaccines for all people, regardless of age, income, or insurance status.
	•	Acknowledge the disabling impacts of COVID-19—including Long COVID—and support vaccines as a critical prevention tool.
	•	Engage directly with disability communities in public health planning and communication.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am a physician and mother of three young children. 

As a physician, I am keenly aware of the life-threatening diseases that my colleagues and I rarely see today because of vaccinations. I am referring to polio, congenital rubella syndrome, diphtheria, and Hib, among others. Previous generations of physicians saw children die from epiglottitis, encephalitis, and bacterial meningitis, and suffer permanent disability from polio. 

Unfortunately, due to anti vaccine sentiment, I am hearing from pediatrician colleagues that infants too young to be vaccinated are coming in with pertussis, in some cases critically ill and requiring ICU level care. This is not because their parents chose not to vaccinate, but because the babies were too young to be vaccinated and were exposed to children whose parents made dangerous decisions. This is a direct consequence of declining herd immunity, which is alarming. It is not limited to pertussis - this is merely one example. We are terrified to face devastating illnesses that we have minimal experience treating due to the luxury of vaccination. 

 As a mother, I don’t believe that most vaccine-hesitant parents want to put their child or others at risk. I believe they are misled by misinformation and lack understanding of how to access or comprehend digestible, evidence-based information.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.


Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

&quot;Before I begin today, I must note that the current ACIP committee appointed by RFK Jr. is a sham committee of known anti-vaccine advocates with fringe anti-scientific beliefs, who will assuredly take actions that undermine the public health of the United States.

They do not have the expertise within their fields to perform their duties, they do not have the experiential history of the dozens of recent ACIP committee meetings to effectively perform their duties, and they are entering this committee with opinions not based upon the cumulative scientific evidence that is agreed upon by the bulk majority of the field to make rational informed decisions. 

While it is evident that this committee will not take public or scientific opinions into this matter, these are the science-backed recommendations that must be stipulated. 

While I am advocating today for universal access to all vaccines so that they will be covered by health insurance plans, making then accessible to the public. I will be focusing on covid vaccine access.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am a Licensed Masters Social Worker and I have received a COVID booster every year, including 2 when I was pregnant as recommended by my OB. Vaccines are safe and effective and I want to continue to receive them to protect my own health, my child’s health, and the health of my friends and community. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. I want my child to continue receiving ...
