For too long, unelected career bureaucrats in the federal government have stifled efficiency by undermining the plans and policies of the Chief Executive.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

That vision has been extraordinarily successful, but now is at risk because Schedule F assumes the opposite: It treats scientific independence as a threat to be minimized. Federally supported science has been so successful, in no small part, because agency staff are typically expert scientists beholden to ensuring that the agencies deliver world-class science. That would all change if agency staff are turned into political appointees.

My primary concern is that this rule, particularly through the creation of a new &quot;Schedule Policy/Career&quot; (Schedule P/C) classification, will lead to the unacceptable politicization of positions that have historically and rightly been filled by career professionals dedicated to impartial public service.
The reclassification of potentially tens of thousands of federal employees into an &quot;at-will&quot; status, stripping them of vital civil service protections, is a deeply concerning development. Such a change risks transforming a merit-based civil service, designed to ensure that federal employees are hired and retained based on expertise and experience, into one where political loyalty becomes a paramount consideration. This would undermine the impartial administration of laws and the effective delivery of government services to the American public.
Career civil servants provide essential continuity, objective analysis, and institutional knowledge that transcends political administrations. Subjecting these roles to political whim by removing protections against arbitrary dismissal will likely deter qualified individuals from entering or remaining in public service, diminish the quality of expert advice available to policymakers, and could foster an environment where decisions are made to ap...

I strongly this proposed rule. I have been a federal employee for 16 years, and my mother was a federal employee for 38 years. We both served our country and the American people with pride, under presidents from different parties and under people we didn&#039;t vote for. I greatly value our hiring systems and protections and the Hatch Act, which allow us to provide honest, unbiased feedback and service to the administration, and to be listened to regardless of our personal views. This proposed rule undermines these systems that have served us well by allowing partisan supporters to be put into jobs, or for sound advice to be ignored because it comes from voters of another party. I have served the United States in countries where the civil service turns over with every change of leader, and it results in higher corruption, low efficiency in government services, and lower trust in government. Putting &quot;yes men&quot; in jobs formerly filled by civil servants will result in worse outcomes for our country. Protect the Civil Service and withdraw this proposed rule.">This is in regard to a proposed rule from, Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80).

• Grant-making is not policy-making and it is concerning that it is viewed that way.  Grant-making has the goal of supporting work to increase scientific knowledge. Grants should be reviewed and funded based on the quality and potential of the science they propose. Science is non-partisan and non-political.  

• Civil service protection has been in place for generations of non-partisan workers who are devoted to serving their country.  We will not be able to recruit the best, unbiased people to these roles if their job security depends on the views and whims of political factions.
• American science is already handicapped by short-term appropriations, e.g., annual appropriations for the NIH, making it harder to fund long-term projects.  Scientific advances take time, often years.  The turnover produced by politicizing appointments at NIH and other funding agencies would be damaging.

• Experience and expertise matter a great deal, and this approach risks bringing in people with insufficient experience and expertise to make good decisions.
