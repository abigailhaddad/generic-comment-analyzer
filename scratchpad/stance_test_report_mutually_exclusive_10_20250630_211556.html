I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access ... [truncated]">To the CDC ACIP committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously h...

Good day,

I&#039;m sharing this comment today to express my concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for most infectious diseases are extremely low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health and kill people. No one, but especially children, should die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable, safe, and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating barriers to covid vaccine access for either children or adults is harmful to the public’s health and contributes to the spread of disease. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutab...

By the year 2000, no one died and no one was hospitalized with severe measles. The main reason we are now seeing some measles outbreaks is that some children are not being immunized. Vaccines are generally very safe, but the public is confused because of misinformation. The ACIP is key to reversing this trend and providing scientifically-based information to the public. The ACIP should be free of political influence so that they can make objective, science-based decisions. ACIP members should be required to disclose financial and other conflicts of interest.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

As someone who has had the privilege to receive regular vaccinations over the course of my life, I cannot understate the important it is to me and my community that all children have access to the same opportunities. It is a gross injustice to refute decade... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

2) Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
3) ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

I believe the COVID shots are bioweapons that were unleashed on the human population. The makers knew they were dangerous and would cause much damage, including death, to people of all ages. They were also aware that these shots were weakening the immune system and people would develop autoimmune issues, heart issues. Likely shortening the lifespan for those who succumbed to taking the shots. This was an intentional act. And it was a horrendous act. Everyone one of those shots should be taken off the market and destroyed. The makers should not make one more dime on this product.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a ...

I am a grief therapist and just saw a 27 year old woman in my office yesterday who lost her 30 year old fiance suddenly at the beginning of June after he suffered a massive heart attack.  He had NO health complications whatsoever and had just seen a doctor the month prior.  The heart attack happened out of nowhere.  The autopsy showed nothing, and the only thing the family can point to is that he got his Covid vaccine 2 days prior to the heart attack.  Devasting.
All this said....
I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – 30 year old died suddenly

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Growing up, I distinctly remember a classmate contracting bacterial meningitis, a truly terrifying experience for our school community. The fear of what could have been, and the serious, long-term health complications she faced, left a lasting impression on me and my family. This experience deeply ingrained in me the life-saving power of vaccines. They aren&#039;t just medical interventions; they represent a critical shield of protection, ensuring that families don&#039;t have to endure such severe and potentially devastating illnesses. For me, vaccines are a cornerstone of public health, offering a future where preventable diseases no longer cast long shadows over our communities.

I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These independent scientists and clinicians played a crucial role in assessing the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved vaccines. They also guided insurance coverage, including for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

Vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are currently very low, leading to outbreaks of preventable illnesses like measles, pertussis, and COVID across the U.S. These infections can cause severe, lasting health consequences. No child in 2025 should suffer o... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Healthcare professionals of all ages deserve vaccine protection in order to remain healthy to care for the sick/elderly.
All ages deserve to have access to COVID-19 vaccines/boosters should they choose to take them to help protect themselves and their loved ones from the dangerous outcomes of COVID and/or Long COVID.

So, I am writing to express the horror I see unfolding in relation to the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Kennedy, Jr. These former members are independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee who carried out a pivotal role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage, as well as coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

Many of these infections have the potential to lead to serious and lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not have to die or become disabled from infectious diseases just because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. Allowing this to continue to happen would be willful neglect.

Why should Americans have fewer tools to protect their health than those in other countries?

During Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#039;s confirmation hearings, he repeatedly assured members of the Senate that he would not use his position to push an anti-vaccine agenda, and he guaranteed he would not touch ACIP. Now, he has fired every single member of ACIP and tried to replace them with people who will support his anti-vaccine agenda, the very thing he said before Congress he would not do. It is imperative that RFK Jr. reinstate the removed members of ACIP and maintain the CDC’s ACIP independent decision process regarding vaccines to ensure that Americans have uninterrupted access to vaccines that have been proven safe and previously approved.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Everyone in my family has received every recommended COVID-19 vaccine and booster—everyone, from age 80 down to our 2.5-year-old toddler. As a result, none of us were hospitalized or suffered severe impacts from COVID-19 compared to many other people we know who did get incredibly sick or have long-lasting sequelae from COVID. Further, not a single person I know suffered any adverse effect besides a sore arm for a day. It is one thing to allow people some choice in whether they choose to vaccinate (although certain vaccines really should mandatory), but it is abhorrent to make decisions that limit people’s ability to obtain vaccines they choose to receive. All Americans should have access to COVID-19 (and all other vaccines) and insurers and Medicaid should have to cover them for the benefit of public health. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

I am writing to you not only as a dedicated educator and public servant but also as a COVID-19 long hauler whose life has been deeply affected by this virus. The continued availability and accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines is not just a matter of public health policy—it is a matter of survival and basic quality of life for individuals like me.

Scientific research has consistently demonstrated that COVID-19 vaccines are both safe and effective. They have saved countless lives, prevented severe illness, and reduced strain on our healthcare system. For individuals with ongoing health complications from COVID-19, like myself, vaccination offers a critical line of defense that helps prevent reinfection and worsening of symptoms.

As a teacher, I am exposed to potential infection every day. Limiting or losing access to COVID-19 vaccination would jeopardize not only my own health but the well-being of my students, colleagues, and the broader community. The ripple effects of such a policy decision would be deeply felt in our schools and beyond.

I urge you to consider the very real consequences of restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for vulnerable populations, frontline workers, and those of us still grappling with long-term effects. Ensuring ongoing, equitable access to these vaccines is essential to protecting public health and maintaining trust in our healthcare system.

Summary
Background WHO, as requested by its member states, launched the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 
1974 to make life-saving vaccines available to all globally. To mark the 50-year anniversary of EPI, we sought to 
quantify the public health impact of vaccination globally since the programme’s inception.
Methods In this modelling study, we used a suite of mathematical and statistical models to estimate the global and 
regional public health impact of 50 years of vaccination against 14 pathogens in EPI. For the modelled pathogens, we

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
Good morning or afternoon RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee,
 Thank you for taking your time to read my comment. I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. 
I am up to date on all my vaccines, including tetanus, because they are important. I get my flu vaccine annually every year because it&#039;s important. I have been getting covid vaccines as frequently as recommended because it&#039;s important. I don&#039;t need non-experts sticking their noses and messing with things they have no right messing with as has been happening this past month or so (June 2025). 
I&#039;d like to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

He’s actively suppressing updates about Covid, bird flu, food borne illnesses and chronic infectious as well.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am someone who routinely gets the Covid vaccine each winter as a way of protecting myself, my loved ones -- one of whose had a compromised immune system -- and my community, as I live in NYC, where, due to the density, transportation options, and worse air quality, COVID is of grave concern, and ending or even shortening chains of transmission is key to preventing more death and long term effects, like long-COVID. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectiou...

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I would like to express my stance, as a citizen of the United States, on the importance of public availability to the COVID vaccines. In the interest of public health and personal safety, I must urge you to halt any efforts to restrict who may access this life-saving medicine.

Since the Advisory Commit ee on Immuniza�on Prac�ces (ACIP)  was formally established by the 
Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service back in 1964, it has  played an increasingly

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. As a medical student, I see firsthand the importance of vaccines in keeping patients healthy. While patients rightfully have the autonomy to refuse vaccines, availability of safe and effective vaccines, including currently approved COVID vaccines, must be preserved.

These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

First Both Moderna and Pfizer EUA authorised Process 2 product potency considerably exceeds safe

Pfizer and Moderna processes; Process 1, a trial “mock up” and Process 2 “upscale”. Pfizer is described later; 
Moderna published their findings about the two processes in December 2020. The image below shows how

My husband and I have no financial or other conflict of interest with the vaccination approval process. We expect ACIP members to disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest, for transparent government. 

Currently available FDA-approved vaccines have been proven safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people, who rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage. 

I urge ACIP to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US. Specifically, please make a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually. My husband and I have been getting COVID vaccines twice a year and have stayed healthy!

2. Currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective.
Children, adults, and pregnant people all rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

3. We need a universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually.">I have no financial conflicts of interest to disclose that are relevant to the topic.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutab...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including pr...

As clinicians, scientists, and advocates dedicated to advancing women&#039;s health, we are particularly attuned to the importance of the HPV vaccine in preventing HPV-associated cancers and related diseases. We appreciate the Committee’s ongoing evaluation of HPV vaccination schedules and its efforts to incorporate emerging data into its deliberations.
As ACIP continues to consider evolving global evidence—such as studies suggesting that a single dose of the HPV vaccine may offer significant protection—we urge the Committee to weigh this data alongside the regulatory framework established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Currently, the FDA-approved regimen for HPV vaccination in the United States recommends a two- or three-dose series based on age and immunocompetence.
The FDA has clearly indicated that further clinical data would be required before any change to the approved HPV vaccine regimen could be considered. Until that standard is revised, recommendations that suggest a one-dose alternative—however promising—may inadv...

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Unfortunately, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are low enough that communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. As someone disabled by COVID, I can personally attest many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on a person’s health. 

In contradiction to the CDC’s mission to protect the public’s health, RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Updated mRNA and traditional COVID vaccines should be widely available to the public and fully covered by health insurance. 

It is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, as well as unethical to give a study participant a placebo when an effective treatment exists.

Over 60 medical groups including American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are urging insurers to keep covering COVID vaccines in pregnancy after HHS dropped the recommendation. They warn that new barriers could endanger maternal and infant health, emphasizing that COVID vaccines are safe and protective.

COVID infection during pregnancy was found to lead to high inflammatory cytokines in the baby’s cord blood at birth. Specific cytokines correlated with specific developmental delays seen in the child at 6 months and at 24 months of age. In children who had been exposed to in utero COVID infection, 36% had cognitive delays, 64% had communication delays and 57% of these children had motor delays at age 2 suggesting that in utero immune activation may impact early brain development. This is another reason to vaccinate pregnant patients to protect them and their baby’s long term development.

I am writing today to express my concern and disgust at the firing of all 17 CDC ACIP members by RFK Jr.—all of whom were expert scientists and clinicians with years of experience in the realm of vaccine safety—and his appointment of new committee members who are not only inexperienced and lack knowledge of vaccine safety and efficacy, but are also known anti-vaccine and anti-science advocates who do not belong anywhere near this committee or any public health organization. This action actively works against the public health of Americans and will only lead to further mistrust of the institution of scientific research and expertise that is already taking hold of this country in devastatingly harmful ways. Already, vaccination rates in both children and adults are too low in many parts of our country to provide sufficient community-level immunity for extremely harmful vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID-19. These diseases are highly infectious and can cause serious, potentially life-threatening or lifelong health consequences, particularly for children, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised. FDA-approved and authorized vaccines for these and many other gravely harmful diseases are already known to be safe and efficacious and should be available to and recommended for everyone in society to avoid the unnecessary sickness and death of our children and most vulnerable.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market.

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

As we live in the United States, ACIP committee members may feel that recommending vaccines increases public spending as more folks are keen to participate in public health and/or insured vaccination programs. I would like to remind you that upfront costs dwarf the hospitalization bills that letting vaccine-preventable infectious disease complications create. Vaccines should be (or continue to be) available. More so, letting individuals choose to vaccinate and protect to reduce the spread of infectious diseases improves the health of all Americans and travelers. Finally, it is unethical to demand new strains or improved vaccines be measured against placebos when RCTs should be measured against current protocols so all trial participants are either protected or doing their bit for improved benefit. On a personal note, I want to take a current SARS-COV2 (covid) vaccine every 4 to 6 months until a better one is developed and approved.">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

RFK&#039;s dismissal of the ACIP members all at once was highly irregular and seems to be motivated by anti-vaccine ideology promoted by organizations that RFK has been a part of (and this ideology is contrary to the repeated findings of science).

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

I have three children and am grateful that all of them have had access to all the vaccines that will keep them - and those vulnerable around them - safe and healthy.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. I am personally grateful my pregnancy days are behind me, but I worry about all the future pregnant women who may not have access to this important vaccine dur... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I am a retired PhD epidemiologist highly concerned about recent decisions limiting access to vaccines. &quot;Shared decision making&quot; does not ensure access for vulnerable people. It ensures more hurdles - MD appointments and out of cost expenses. It discriminates against higher risk people at a tremendous cost of excess morbidity and mortality especially for working age adults. It also increases lack of clarity and guidance for vaccination during pregnancy to protect 0-6 month olds from COVID hospitalizations and death.

In simple graphics, here are pieces of evidence for the need for continued universal access to COVID vaccines:

It’s appalling how quickly evidence-based, public health prevention and guidance has been so quickly replaced by opinion-based, political decision makers.

What these decision makers fail to embrace are fundamental principles: that vaccines save lives, that we need more effort and funding to overcome vaccine hesitancy, vaccine misinformation, and limited vaccine access.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I am writing today because I am afraid of the outcome from the recent termination of all 17 members of
the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have
an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial
role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized
vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the
Vaccines for Children program. That is a lot of responsibility that was just completely undermined with
one action. This is in no way democratic!
Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across
the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis,
and COVID. Sadly this is only more evidence in the effectiveness and benefit of vaccines. Many of
these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in
2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to
affordable and effective vaccines.

As a concerned member of the public, and grandmother to 13 children, I urge the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to reconsider the inclusion of the COVID-19 vaccine in the pediatric immunization schedule. Evidence indicates that children are at a significantly lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection and related complications, making the perceived benefits of universal vaccination for this population minimal. 

Moreover, current data do not conclusively establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in children. As with any medical intervention, rigorous evaluation and transparency are essential to ensure that benefits outweigh risks. The relatively low incidence of severe outcomes in children, combined with uncertainties regarding vaccine safety, suggests that the vaccine should not be mandated or universally recommended for the pediatric population at this time.

It is also important to recognize that the childhood vaccine schedule is already quite burdensome for parents and children alike. Proper double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have not been conducted on all other vaccines currently recommended, which warrants caution. Adding another vaccine that has not undergone comprehensive, long-term safety evaluation would be imprudent and, arguably, a form of medical malpractice.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people. 

As a teacher, I work with these children and want them to be healthy and successful. By following vaccine schedules that are scientifically proven, the students can stay healthy and alive.

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I grew up in the era where vaccines against polio, measles, rubella and other infectious diseases virtually eliminated the cases and deadly impact of these diseases.  My Mom was a nurse who saw many people get sick, have life changing impacts or die from infectious diseases.  She spoke often about how important it was that all people get vaccinated to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.  More recently, COVID vaccines greatly reduced the hospitalization and death rate from COVID.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

RFK Jr. is ignoring science and bending studies to fit his anti-vaxx agenda. We’ve already seen how his false narrative about the safety of vaccines can impact communities with the recent measles outbreak, which was made exponentially worse by low vaccination rates. 

The COVD vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, and to lower one’s chances of dying from COVID. It is critical that mothers, young children, and the community at large have access to this vaccine if they so choose. 

RFK Jr. is running through the health department with a hacksaw and ripping out any information and any experts who stand in his way — at a time when trust in medicine is already at a low. This is not how a government agency should be run. We should be listening to impartial experts — the people who have devoted years of their lives learning and studying, and use actual scientific FACTS to support their claims. 

1.	RFK Jr. must maintain an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.

Remove every Covid shot from the CDC&#039;s Recommended Childhood Vaccine Schedule NOW! You&#039;re a breath away from being murderers if you continue to recommend these barbaric practices. I, for one, am keenly aware that what you call a vaccine is NOT a vaccine at all, and it is NOT safe and effective. In fact, the opposite is true. The science and evidence is clear -- these stupid jabs are not only hurting children, teen, and adults, the jabs are downright killing them. 

ACIP members, please take a firm honest stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. But 38,666 deaths following COVID vaccination have been reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System as of May 30, 2025. What gives? You are insane if you continue recommending these toxic shots. All vaccines should be subject to a gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing.

If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Anthrax is a disease that, ironically, can be contracted by ingesting dirt, even if accidentally. If you contract it and aren’t vaccinated, you have a 90% chance of dying. People in rural communities are especially impacted here as it can spread from animals (livestock) to people. It can enter the body via open wounds, via airways, and via the mouth. Basically every disease here can cause fever, chills, headache, body aches, and/or cough, sore throat, fatigue, and other common symptoms. Anthrax, in particular, causes massive painful blisters and malformations.

Ebola causes your body to bleed from the inside out. First, you lose almost all of your energy to do anything. Then everything starts hurting. Then you start vomiting and expelling diarrhea. Then you lose the ability to filter your own blood. And finally your blood vessels start leaking, and paramedics get to watch blood leak from your gums. Fun, right?

Diphtheria is a disease that causes a toxic coating to form in the back of your throat. This coating must be removed to treat the illness, but it can be broken when attempting removal, releasing a huge load of toxic compounds that kills you. This disease kills 20% of the children it infects.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I cannot emphasize strongly enough how necessary it is to my and my family&#039;s health that the current schedule of vaccination for children and adults - including last year&#039;s permissive recommendations on the Covid vaccine - be retained.  Consequently, today I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to you today as a clinical research coordinator of pediatric vaccine studies at the University of Pennsylvania, specifically looking at vaccine efficacy. I am here to express my grave concerns about the rampant disinformation surrounding the importance of vaccines, and the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Access to affordable, free, safe, easily accessible vaccines has a profoundly positive impact on my life and the lives of my fellow community members. As a 40 year old, there are many conditions I do not have to think about that previous generations did- polio, measles- and others I would have to google because  I DON&#039;T KNOW ABOUT THEM thanks to vaccines!

As a mental health therapist I see first hand how profoundly challenging illness and disability can be on people&#039;s lives- emotionally, physically, financially, socially. I have friends and clients with long COVID, auto-immune disorders, cancer, and other chronic Illnesses. While many of these conditions are not preventable by vaccine, others are (COVID, cervical cancer, etc). An ounce of prevention is worth a pound in cure and treatment and the CDC should be doing everything it can to prevent preventable infections and diseases! 

These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guidin... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plays a critical role in safeguarding public health, and I appreciate the committee’s commitment to evaluating data on safety, efficacy, and population needs.

Vaccines have consistently demonstrated their ability to prevent serious illness, reduce hospitalizations, and save lives. From long-standing vaccines such as those for influenza, HPV, and meningococcal disease, to newer vaccines for COVID-19 and RSV, each has been subject to extensive clinical trials and real-world surveillance. These interventions not only protect individuals but also contribute to community immunity, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations such as infants, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions.

I urge the committee to continue supporting recommendations based on robust data and to ensure that the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program includes access to all ACIP-recommended vaccines. Equitable access and clear, evidence-based guidelines are essential in maintaining public trust and improving health outcomes nationwide.

Thank you for your dedication to public health and for your thorough, transparent review process.">As a healthcare professional and advocate for evidence-based medicine, I strongly support the continued use of rigorous scientific review to guide vaccine recommendations.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

ACIP Members,

You have a monumental responsibility to us (the public) to make sure vaccines are truly safe.  The previous committee did not pay attention to the numerous alarming safety signals coming out of VAERS concerning the COVID vaccines.  I beg you to please look at the VAERS data (as well as the V-Safe data) and remove all currently licensed COVID vaccines off the market, at least until that data has been thoroughly reviewed and studied.

I&#039;m also requesting that you require all vaccines be subject to double-blind inert placebo studies prior to licensing, just as the rest of pharmaceuticals are.  The weak studies that have been done on vaccines in years past (particularly those on the childhood schedule) have only been studied against other vaccines.  This is a sorely inadequate practice in which to gauge safety.  At the very least, please look at existing HMO data for both vaccinated and unvaccinated children and compare the instances of chronic diseases, allergies, ADHD, autism, death, etc. to determine if there are any safety signals.  If you truly believe in the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule, you have nothing to lose by doing this study.

I can only imagine that each of you originally studied medicine and science with a goal of helping people and making things better for people.  Please remember why you got into this profession in the first place and resist the temptation of the money and power offered ... [truncated]">ACIP – Please look at the safety signals in VAERS

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health, and is personally very disconcerting to me as a person with a spouse with severe autoimmune issues. Protecting her is part of my responsibility as a spouse, and protecting others in my community is part of my responsibility as a citizen. As such, I believe tha...

As a disabled person, I am extremely worried about curtailed access to vaccines, not only for disabled people but people who are considered healthy.  The disabled community relies heavily on a protected healthy group to further ensure our protection.  It takes one virus to disable a person - which is what happened to me.  Seeing people cut down in their prime is not enjoyable.  Seeing CHILDREN go through the same thing, their lives dramatically altered by preventable diseases is an exercise in cruelty. 

The net result of removing these protections is counter to the narrative and rhetoric of conservatives who bemoan entitlements to those in need.  They will be creating more people who will need to rely on entitlements because of illness and disability through their maleficence.

The tide of misinformation and dismantling of institutions serving the public must be stemmed if we are to protect public health and protect people&#039;s lives.">I am an average citizen with no conflicts of interest to disclose.

1. RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
2. Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
3. ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
4. ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
5. ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.
My children have lived relatively disease free due to vaccines- keeping them in school, and as at work.

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine acces... [truncated]">Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a wa...

With influenza A the highest it&#039;s been in fifteen years and the proliferation of the highly lethal bird flu among humans, it is perplexing to me that I live in &quot;the greatest country in the world&quot;, if not the wealthiest, yet it cannot guarantee clean air or routine immunization to its citizens. There is no time to waste with vaccine skepticism, denial of medical care and implementation of medical devices, and scrutiny over which safety regulations should be laxed. The belief that the threat of COVID is long in the past, and that masks, social distancing, and other methods of mitigation were unnecessary nightmares of an oppressive quarantine to be left in 2020, is not in the interest of public health; what is popular and comforting to believe does not reflect the reality of the data or the science providing it. It is the of job of the FDA and ACIP to protect Americans not by encouraging delusions, but by instituting accurate, fact- and science-based mitigation measures and regulations that keep us safe.

This level of scientific fluency is the minimum necessary for ACIP decision-making, a role that impacts the health of over 340 million people. 

I am concerned that many of the new members of the now completely reconstituted ACIP do not have this requisite expertise.  It appears that most of them have not specialized in any area of science or medicine relevant to the ACIP’s remit, roles and responsibilities.  Rather, these new members seem to have primarily come to prominence as social media serial tweeters who have repeatedly presented views – against all scientific and medical evidence – that were anti-vaccine and anti-COVID vaccine. In their social media postings, they persistently posted debunked studies and pushed policy that would have resulted in millions of more deaths IF they were actually true/implemented. Further, they have refused and/or been unable (due to their lack of expertise) to talk to their audiences about conflicting data reports.

Given these realities, I am requesting that the new ACIP committee discuss the following areas of urgent concern, and immediately issue the requested written statements/explanation...

Boosters adapted to the circulating varianst are important because 1. Immunity acquired by vaccination or infection both wane and 2. Cross-protection among different variants is limited.
Pregnant women are themselves at higher risk of severe disease of they become infected with SARS-CoV-2. They need to have the option to protect themselves by vaccination. COVID was found to increase the risk of stillbirth by roughly twofold, and during the delta wave, roughly fourfold (1). 
Since in the last trimester of pregnancy, IgG antibodies are actively transported across the placenta, recent vaccination before or during pregnancy also provides the baby with substantial antibody protection (2). This is why vaccination of mothers during pregnancy was 52% effective in preventing hospitalization of the infant for COVID-19 in the first 6 months of life (3). This is important because infants under 1 year of age are the most vulnerable to COVID-19 among the pediatric age groups.

Do not underestimate the importance of continuing to allow everyone to get COVID-19 vaccines. This impacts everyone. You, me, everyone. If you make the wrong choice here, you do realize there might very well be nobody left able-bodied and alive to actually keep the country running, right...? Like, anybody at all?

You can choose the future.
Do not underestimate what has fallen into your hands at this moment.
It is not to be taken lightly.

Stand for freedom. Stand for liberty. It isn&#039;t freedom to not be given the choice to get a vaccine, it isn&#039;t good for the economy, it isn&#039;t good for anybody. So don&#039;t let that be the outcome here. It&#039;s rather literally direly important.

I lost loved ones to Covid and know people still struggling with the effects of long Covid. 

These vaccines saved lives and allowed me to continue to run my school safely. 

I write to you to ask you to take action in the following ways, on behalf of my family, my students, and my community. 

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors. Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest. ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage. ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US. ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.">I am a parent, public school educator, and active member of my community.

I am writing to express my deepest concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

I am writing as someone who believes in the power of vaccines to save lives and protect communities. Growing up, I saw how diseases like polio and measles became distant threats thanks to widespread immunization. Now, as an adult, I’ve watched COVID-19 vaccines do the same—keeping hospitals from overflowing, shielding vulnerable loved ones, and allowing society to recover. That’s why I’m deeply troubled by any efforts to restrict access to these vaccines based on politics rather than science.  

The recent push to limit COVID-19 vaccine availability—whether through reduced recommendations, insurance hurdles, or baseless skepticism—ignores overwhelming evidence of their safety and effectiveness. These vaccines have prevented countless deaths and cases of long COVID, yet some policymakers are now treating them as optional rather than essential. This is a dangerous shift. When vaccines become harder to access, misinformation fills the gap, and preventable outbreaks follow. We cannot let distrust and bureaucracy undo decades of public health progress.  

I urge the CDC to:  
1. Maintain universal eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring no one is denied based on age or arbitrary risk assessments.  
2. Require full insurance coverage so cost is never a barrier.  
3. Reject politically motivated interference in vaccine policy—decisions must be guided by independent experts, not ideology.

I am a public health expert, more qualified to be on this committee than any of the folks seated by Sec. Kennedy. It is my professional opinion that allowing the newly appointed members to weigh-in on anything related to vaccines flies in the face of all things we know about public health and vaccines. 

Science is not based on opinions, it’s based on evidence and facts. Research has shown overwhelming that the vaccines on the ACIP recommendation schedule are safe and effective.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID-19. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines must be available to everyone and not limited to only some people.
I am a high-risk individual with multiple mood disorders as a result of my time working as a frontline healthcare worker from 2020 to 2022. It is important for me to have access to all vaccines and their boosters, and for my family members, healthy or otherwi... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members 
of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former 
members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP 
committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-
approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for 
uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for 
many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly 
affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID-
19. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their 
health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of 
a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines must be availabl... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

My name Lexie Jones Packham, I am a new PGY1 Internal Medicine - Pediatrics doctor in CT. I am writing to express my concern about several issues listed on the ACIP&#039;s June meeting agenda. 
My two primary concerns revolve around the COVID vaccine availability and the vote about thimerosal-containing vaccines. I am concerned that the new guideline to NOT recommend the COVID vaccine to pregnant people and healthy children will cause an increase in hospitalizations and death, especially during these upcoming winter months. I am pregnant myself and, having read the research and seen many patients with COVID in the hospital, I am planning on getting the COVID vaccine to protect me and my child from contracting it. Even though I am a doctor, I am still in training and most of my paycheck goes to paying student loans. If my insurance doesn&#039;t cover the COVID or flu vaccine this winter, it will be a financial hardship for me to have to pay for it myself - which I will do regardless, because I need to protect myself and my baby, and the sick patients I take care of in the hospital who need their doctor to be healthy and not spread viruses. 
I am also concerned about the vote about thimerosal-containing vaccines. As you know, of the extensive research that has been done on thimerosal, including by the CDC itself, no negative effects have been shown from the small amounts of thimerosal found in vaccines except for local injection site redness and swelling.

Instead, he fired them all and replaced them with people with far fewer qualifications, several of whom are well known anti-vaxxers.
If the ACIP meeting continues, I am writing to request:
1.	Maintain universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for all ages, which includes broadening Novavax BLA approval to allow access for all ages even in the absence of underlying conditions.
2.	Maintain the current COVID-19 vaccine guidelines for Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised People, allowing people to self-confirm immunocompromised status without documentation.
3.	Maintain the current list of qualifying underlying conditions that have been shown to put people at Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19. Furthermore, continue to allow self-confirmation of these underlying conditions for all ages under shared clinical decision making.
4.	Recommend that vaccines be released by August 1 so kids heading back to school can have better protection. COVID-19 is not a seasonal virus like the flu, so it doesn’t make sense to keep treating it like one.
Novavax-specific:
1.	Recommend pediatric Novavax expansion, so we can have a pediatric mRNA alternative.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it i...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express serious concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, as seen through recent measles, whooping cough, and COVID outbreaks and infections. 
I have serious concerns about the recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations. EVERYONE should have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, covered by insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. I am particularly worried about the risk of long COVID, which vaccines have been shown to reduce. Please take action to reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for everyone at least once a year.
Thank you.">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I am appalled at the fact these are still on the market and being promoted. I have several friends who have sustained &quot;mysterious&quot; symptoms after receiving the so called vaccine and have been following the tragic stories of many people who thought they were doing the right thing by receiving the vaccine. Also, the fact that it has been recommended for our children disgusts me, showing that there is no regard for our children.  It is clear that greed has taken precedence over human lives.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. I acquired Long COVID as a result of a COVID infection, which currently threatens my ability to work due to impairments in my short term memory and cognitive processing ability. As a new university graduate, I shouldn&#039;t have to be in the position of losing a career that&#039;s barely started - it is both a waste of my potential and that of US institutions&#039; resources to limit access to vaccines from a monetary and moral standpoint. My personal experience is not a one-off... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Instead, he fired them all and replaced them with people with far fewer qualifications, several of whom are well known anti-vaxxers.
If the ACIP meeting continues, I am writing to request:
1.Maintain universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for all ages, which includes broadening Novavax BLA approval to allow access for all ages even in the absence of underlying conditions.
2.Maintain the current COVID-19 vaccine guidelines for Moderately to Severely Immunocompromised People, allowing people to self-confirm immunocompromised status without documentation.
3.Maintain the current list of qualifying underlying conditions that have been shown to put people at Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19. Furthermore, continue to allow self-confirmation of these underlying conditions for all ages under shared clinical decision making.
4.Recommend that vaccines be released by August 1 so kids heading back to school can have better protection. COVID-19 is not a seasonal virus like the flu, so it doesn’t make sense to keep treating it like one.

The United States should not be forced to live in the pre-industrial era public health landscape that the current crop of nominees seem to want to conjure up.  CDC ACIP expert advisors must support widespread and  access to a the broad range of existing safe and effective vaccines; and they must be capaable of evaluating the scientific evidence in order to determine who should have access to new vaccines that provide protection from infectious diseases or prevent the long term sequelae infections.

In particular, the ACIP committee should provide where possible universal access to safe and effective vaccines, leaving the decisions about individual cost benefit analysis to patients in consultation with their health care providers.  COVID-19 vaccines should be available for children, for adults of all ages, for pregnant women.  There is zero evidence to show that pregnant women should not be vaccinated, and plenty of evidence of dangers of Covid to both women and fetuses.

Are they actively practicing or licensed Physicians?  If they have no qualifications or active practice in any of these scientific areas, please disclose an accounting to the taxpaying public as to why and what their specific areas of expertise is and why it would make them competent to be tasked with making incredibly important medical decisions for the United States public.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on... [truncated]">Thanks to the vaccine, I'm able to worry less about fatal consequences and death from covid.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

The words I am about to say are rooted in science, logic, and a deep understanding of infectious disease and the healthcare system, as someone who is a cancer survivor and currently disabled. I fear for children, healthy people, and other vulnerable groups like myself, who may lose vaccine access under this current administration. It has been proven that vaccines prevent severe illness, and we all deserve to be able to access that tool of healthcare, whether we want to or not. Refusing to get vaccinated is a choice - not a mandate. And we should all be able to make that choice freely. If vaccine access is taken away, it will no longer be a choice. Lack of access is just as heavy-handed as mandating vaccines. The removal of choice is something I ask the Committee to consider carefully. Revoking this access puts cancer-survivors like me, my healthy family, my coworkers who have children, and many others at risk of death or lifelong health complications, as unvaccinated individuals have shown to have more severe outcomes after contracting COVID-19. Regardless of if the committee thinks COVID is still a threat to people (even though there is currently a strain called NB.1.8.1 giving everyone I know &quot;razor blade throat&quot;), I urge the committee to keep COVID vaccines universally accessible, so tha...

Kennedy Jr.’s recent decision to disband his vaccine advisory committee. This move is not only irresponsible, but dangerous — especially for the most vulnerable among us: children.

Vaccines remain one of the most effective tools we have to prevent the spread of deadly diseases. From measles to polio, the science is clear: immunization saves lives. Disregarding decades of peer-reviewed evidence and public health consensus risks undoing the progress we&#039;ve made over generations.

Removing expert oversight on vaccine policy is not just politically reckless — it’s a public health hazard. Without qualified medical and scientific advisors, decisions may be made based on ideology rather than evidence. This kind of leadership endangers children, immunocompromised individuals, and entire communities.

We cannot afford to let misinformation or anti-scientific ideology shape policy decisions that affect the health of millions. The consequences of dismantling safeguards could be tragic: outbreaks of preventable diseases, unnecessary suffering, and avoidable deaths — especially among children.

I urge Mr. Kennedy and his campaign to reconsider this dangerous course of action and to restore evidence-based public health leadership to any vaccine policy planning. The lives of our children — and the health of our nation — depend on it.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am a US-born citizen, a healthcare worker, and public health professional. I have been proud and grateful to live in a country with experts in the fields of science, public health, and medicine. I have been privileged in the county to be able to receive the vaccines recommended by the professionals to protect myself and my loved ones from vaccine-preventable illness and death. During the height of the pandemic, I worked in a clinic serving the elderly. These patients were former teachers, veterans, beloved grandparents. Before the COVID vaccine, patients were getting gravely ill and dying from COVID. After the vaccine was introduced, patients and fellow healthcare workers were eager to get vaccinated. I saw the positive impact both mentally and physically the protection the vaccine provided. This country has been a leader in public health and it frightens me to think we could quickly lose what has taken decades of research and innovation to build. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...
