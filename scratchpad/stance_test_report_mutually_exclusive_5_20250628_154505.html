The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  In other words, the Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations.
 
We have seen nationally and in cities like my own city of Chicago how a &quot;spoils system&quot; or a patronage system is corrosive to the human spirit leading to elevation of incompetence and corruption. It is a system based on fealty not fairness and is contradictory to President Trump&#039;s stated goal of efficiency in government.  
 
It is well known that people perform better in their jobs when their knowledge and expertise are acknowledged, when their progress towards goals is measured through established performance metrics, and when they are trusted and respected.

I am writing to highlight significant administrative law deficiencies in this NPRM&#039;s approach to rescinding the April 2024 final rule.
I. Failure to Satisfy State Farm Requirements
This NPRM violates principles established in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers v. State Farm. The NPRM claims the previous rule should be revoked because &quot;Executive Order 14171 has changed the underlying legal authorities.&quot; Federal Register This misunderstands the relationship between executive orders and regulations.
An agency rescinding a rule must provide reasoned analysis at least as detailed as would be required to adopt the rule initially. OPM attempts to bypass this by claiming Executive Order 14171 renders the previous rule &quot;inoperative&quot; without addressing substantive findings.
II. Improper Reliance on Executive Order
The NPRM claims &quot;Executive Order 14171 rendered [previous definitions] inoperative.&quot; Federal Register This misunderstands the APA&#039;s requirements.
Properly promulgated regulations have the force of law and cannot be nullified by executive order alone. If an agency wishes to rescind a regulation due to policy changes, it must follow APA requirements for reasoned decision-making.
III. Inadequate Consideration of Reliance Interests

As a scientist and a member of the American Society for Microbiology, I write to express my concerns with the OPM’s proposal move policy-influencing position into Schedule Policy/Career (Schedule F). 

This proposal undermines the scientific credibility of career professionals and will have a chilling impact on scientific integrity within the federal government. Scientists charged with conducting research and analyzing scientific evidence to inform policymaking, such as environmental regulations or public health recommendations, could be fired if their scientific conclusions do not match the policy preferences of agency officials. The proposal also could lead to a significant loss of institutional knowledge that is invaluable to the administration and innovation of federal government agencies. 

Furthermore, the OPM guidance notes that federal employees with “substantive participation or discretionary grantmaking” should be classified into schedule F. Scientific agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, hire scientists who are experts in their field to facilitate grant review and review proposals to sure that agencies are funding cutting edge and scientifically meritorious work.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

I strongly oppose the reclassification of NIH leadership positions as political appointments under Schedule F. This change would cause demonstrable harm to American health and scientific progress.

Legal and Public Health Concerns:
The proposed rule violates the principle that federal grant decisions should be based on scientific merit, not political allegiance. By subjecting NIH Institute Directors and Division Directors to political appointment, this regulation will:

- Compromise patient outcomes by prioritizing political loyalty over scientific expertise in research leadership

- Waste taxpayer resources through constant leadership turnover that disrupts multi-year research initiatives

- Undermine public safety by politicizing decisions about which diseases and treatments receive federal research funding

- Damage American competitiveness as other nations maintain merit-based scientific leadership while we abandon it

Documented Harm to the Public Interest:
Medical breakthroughs require sustained, expert leadership and long-term planning. Political appointees serving at the pleasure of each administration cannot provide this continuity. The inevitable result is slower progress against diseases that kill and disable millions of Americans.

This regulation essentially transforms life-saving medical research into a political tool. Americans deserve better. Our health depends on scientific excellence, not political calculatio... [truncated]">Public Comment on Proposed Regulation 2025-06904

This regulation will likely politicize federal roles and could be used to penalize employees that are serving job functions that could be viewed as counter to a current administration&#039;s belief system. As a scientist, I view this as a large threat to the integrity of many federal scientific organizations, which the country and its citizens rely on to collect unbiased, reliable, standard datasets that are used by the public and private sectors alike. PoliticiInzing these roles would be catastrophic,  potentially eliminating long-running scientific monitoring programs based on a single administration&#039;s belief. Science is not political and the federal scientists should not be in politicized roles, or we risk the collapse of our current scientific system in the United States. 

Furthermore,  the long-running scientific programs rely on well-trained individuals maintaining positions for more than 4-8 years. The proposed regulation risks significant turnover in these career scientific positions, which will disrupt data standardization, efficiency, and reliability that we need to accurately predict and forcast scientific phenomena like droughts, storms, and vaccine schedules. 

This regulation will diminish the scientific credibility and reliability within the United States and reduce stability in public services many Americans rely on. ">I dissent to this regulation as written. This regulation will likely politicize federal roles and could be used to penalize employees that are serving job functions that could be viewed as counter to a current administration's belief system.

This rule appears to be a direct attempt to implement a tool that would allow political interference with the grant making and grant awarding process. This would politicize agencies like the NIH, NSF, and DoD and greatly diminish the role the scientific expertise has traditionally played in this process.

The rule would change how grants are awarded and would put the persons involved in this process into a politically compromised position because the rule would, for example, place NIH leadership and management into a role that serves &quot;at the will of the president&quot; rather than the current role where they are in place and serve based on their scientific expertise and satisfactory job performance.  

The simple existence of this rule will greatly diminish the scientific integrity of federal grants aimed at supporting scientific discovery, biomedical research, and clinical trials. This means that future scientific results and studies will be compromised and the public will not be able to trust the rigor and reliability of the results of research funded during one administration versus another.

This plan would reclassify tens of thousands of government jobs as “policymaking positions” and therefore subject them to presidential appointment and removal of those who occupy these positions.

To attempt to punish those who &quot;undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives,&quot; while not understanding that every civil servant acts at the DIRECTION of the agency, not on the whim of their own volition, as we are not decisionmakers. 3. To have to explain this to the &quot;government&quot; goes to show that lack of government experience. This is a level of incompetence America has never seen.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,”
Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I, Cindy Sullivan submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM)
Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed
Rule.

I am a very concerned citizen, regular voter, and small business owner.  My interest in the area of Civil Service is based on my long-held belief that we are a country that supports one another and builds us up.  Those workers who have dedicated their work and vocation in the area of Civil Service deserve to be supported by our nation - both government and the populations they support.  These are organizations that provide charitable support to people and wildlife, human rights, foundations, etc.  Their focus has been - and should ALWAYS be - on the work they do.

Federal law has long said that civil servants must be hired, promoted, and retained based on merit—basically: expertise, not political loyalty. Civil servants have had certain protections that have ensured they could exercise their best professional judgment without fear of retaliation for saying or doing something simply because it was unpopular with leadership.  Should this protect... [truncated]">May 23, 2025

Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Institutional knowledge was critical for the operation of the agency and in training new employees.    Implementing Schedule F so that only loyalists are hired for agencies is extremely dangerous.

For example, critical roles in public health, emergency response, international relations, and cybersecurity often fall under &quot;policy-influencing&quot; classifications. Subjecting these roles to at-will dismissal places mission-essential functions at risk, potentially during pandemics, attacks, or natural disasters.

I strongly oppose the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, &quot;Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.&quot;

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

According to the Congressional Research Service,* this proposed rule could reclassify approximately 11,910 senior-level DOD employees — including 3,300 from the Army, 3,112 from the Navy, 1,592 from the Air Force, and 3,906 from other DOD entities — as at-will political appointees.

Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

The proposed implementation/revival of the Schedule F classification for federal employees threatens the nonpartisan federal workforce that has resulted in our stable government and world leadership.

The creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to enable talent (by establishing a merit-based hiring process), not connections (the spoils system) for federal employees. Reclassifying a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—as Schedule F would do, opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and be free from political influence.

Additionally, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees.  Our country enacted protections designed to enable good governance, and protection for its residents.  Stripping thousands...

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity. I am a young federal employee and a union member, and I was drawn to the federal service because I want to help other people. I was enticed by the perks of merit-based promotions and the chance to contribute to the United States without bipartisan politics interfering with delivering services to the American people. The stability and desire to go good, no matter who is president at the time, drew me to federal service. I know other young federal employees who have said they joined federal service for the same reasons.

I hope that the 47 regime realizes what they’re doing to America on the World Stage. We used to be a well respected, patriotic shining beacon. Now, we are becoming as 47 puts it, a “shithole country”. We will no longer be respected, no longer be looked up to, we will only be a laughing stock, that let the lowest IQ individuals, and their cheating (gerrymandering, voter suppression, and voter intimidation) decide our future. We know cheating happened. We KNOW it wasn’t a landslide. In my 67 years here on earth, NO election had been called any sooner than this one. There are still districts that argue the results! Did we all use Ivanka’s trademark voting machines this time? Did Elon do some finagling? We all assume he did.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations.

Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and further damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Scientific progress and sound public policy depend on the stability, independence, and professionalism of the federal workforce. Schedule F poses a direct threat to these principles by enabling the politicization of policy-influencing positions within the government. Removing civil service protections from scientific and technical staff in policy roles creates an environment where decisions may be driven not by evidence, but by political expediency or ideology.

The hallmark of a functioning democracy is a government that protects the free flow of scientific data and objective analysis, regardless of who is in office. Schedule F risks silencing expert voices, discouraging whistleblowers, and undermining public trust in government agencies, including those responsible for public health, environmental protection, energy policy, and climate science.

The mere prospect of such a policy has already caused anxiety in the scientific community and could dissuade talented scientists and researchers from public service.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

The proposed rule converting thousands of career civil service positions to political positions would threaten all people in these positions with replacement with every change in administration. In fact, the rule against &quot;burrowing in&quot; is necessary to ensure that there is change of political appointees, and this new category of Civil Service positions subject to &quot;at will&quot; removal should in fact be considered to be political appointments.
This would result in thousands of additional senior positions being filled with inexperienced people every few years. Program expertise is necessary to ensure the efficient and effective operation of the hundreds of highly technical and complex government programs affecting the health, welfare and security of all Americans.
For the reasons stated above, I oppose the proposed rule.

Removing merit-based civil service protections opens the door to replacing nonpartisan, professional civil servants with political loyalists. Doing so increases the risk that executive actions will be decided by the size of political contributions rather than the faithful execution of the law. That increases the risk of politically motivated enforcement of laws, threatening individual liberty; politically-determined tariff exceptions and contract and grant awards, threatening greater corruption and waste of taxpayer dollars; and politically selective provision of services, threatening failure of government operations for disfavored groups or localities. 

Schedule P/C would erode or eliminate the nonpartisan, merit-based civil service, which ensures civil servants are fired based on merit, not political affiliation, a practice that has served our country well since the late 1800s. This basic system protects the honor of the federal government to work on behalf of the American people. It provides continuity through changing administrations and ensures public servants’ primary allegiance is to the Constitution and laws of the United States rather than the individual temporarily holding the office of President. Protection of this practice strengthens our civil service, and our democracy.

The proposed reinstatement of Schedule F, President Trump&#039;s plan that would reclassify tens of thousands of federal employees as &quot;at-will&quot; political appointees—is a direct threat to the nonpartisan integrity of the U.S. civil service. It would strip career professionals of job protections and open the door to political purges based on loyalty rather than merit or expertise.

According to the Partnership for Public Service, Schedule F could affect up to 50,000 federal employees, many of whom are policy experts, scientists, and legal professionals whose work depends on independence and objective analysis—not partisan agendas. Removing civil service protections would allow any administration to fire career officials en masse, replacing them with loyalists who may lack the necessary qualifications or commitment to evidence-based governance [1].

This move represents a dangerous politicization of public institutions, echoing tactics seen in authoritarian regimes where loyalty to the leader overrides allegiance to the constitution or the rule of law. As noted by the National Academy of Public Administration, the impartiality of the civil service is foundational to democracy and public trust [2].

America’s public servants swear an oath to the Constitution—not to any president. Loyalty tests have NO place in a democracy.

I wish to comment on  OPM Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80).  As a career federal employee with over 33 years of government service, I am concerned that changing the rule will lead to unfair firing of federal employees.  I am opposed to passage of the rule that will allow for a large number of federal employees to be classified as “schedule F”.  I am writing these comments based on my own personal concerns and not as a representative of the federal government. 

Over my decades of federal employment I have carried out my responsibilities in the same professional manner, regardless of which political party was in office. I have never felt pressured to change the way I complete my work based on the political leanings of the administration, but I fear that will change if the proposed rule is implemented. 

I understand that some managers may have expressed concern regarding their ability to remove under performing workers in the past, however most government positions, including the one I currently hold, include metrics to objectively track the productivity of employees. Perhaps it would be best to develop a system where management can more easily record and track when employees fail to meet their job responsibilities and deadlines. Developing such a system or database will make it easier for managers to quantitatively demonstrate why an under performing employee should be fired without moving a large swath of employees to schedule F and taking away their prot...

Dear Office of Personnel Management:
I submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM)
Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
Service,
” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed
Rule.
Introduction
1. I have been a federal employee for 13 years. I swore an oath to the constitution and signed a contract. My entire career has been with DoD Army caring for Soldiers and their families. 
I am a masters level licensed clinical social worker specializing in domestic violence, child abuse and care of wounded, ill or injured Soldiers. 
I have worked a majority of my career working at US military installations outside of the US where Soldiers and their families have limited access to resources. 

2. Why does this matter to you?
Federal law has long said that civil servants must be hired, promoted, and retained based on merit—basically: expertise, not political loyalty. Civil servants have had certain protections that have ensured they could exercise their best professional judgment without fear of retaliation. If those protections were taken away, and the civil service was substantially reduced and/or staffed only with political loyalists, how would that affect me? I am my colleague’s are in our positions because we care about our Sol... [truncated]">Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

The proposed rule change would return us to a time where employees political positions and connections would ultimately determine who is hired or retained as opposed to their technical ability to perform a job.

This undermines the merit-based hiring and firing system that is central to a professional and nonpartisan civil service. By attempting to make it easier to remove career civil servants based on political considerations, the changes conflict with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was designed to prevent exactly this kind of politicization of the federal workforce.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

This proposal represents a serious threat to the integrity and effectiveness of the NIH and its mission. NIH leadership roles have historically been filled by nonpartisan career scientists with extensive expertise, selected based on merit and peer reviewed accomplishments. Reclassifying these positions as political undermines scientific independence, injects partisan ideology into evidence based decision making, and risks destabilizing the federal government’s most important biomedical research institution.

This threatens to politicize the peer review process and the allocation of billions in competitive research funding, decisions that must remain free from political influence.

If implemented, this rule would increase turnover in NIH leadership, discourage qualified experts from public service, hinder long-term strategic planning, and weaken the US&#039;s global leadership in science and public health. The consequences could be devastating for research on cancer, infectious disease, mental health, aging, and other critical areas of national concern.

How does OPM justify removing due process protections from positions that have long required nonpartisan expertise? What evidence supports the claim that such drastic changes are necessary to improve government performance?

By making roles that influence policy subject to at-will employment, the regulation invites political interference in areas where objectivity is crucial. How will OPM ensure that scientific, economic, legal, and policy staff are not dismissed for political or ideological reasons? What safeguards will be put in place to prevent retaliatory terminations or the silencing of professional disagreement?

The rationale behind the proposed rule is flawed. There are not numerous poor performing employees in the federal government. Agencies currently have the ability to use performance plans or shift responsibilities for the very small number of employees who may be under-performing. Instead, this proposal will allow agencies to increase the number of politically appointed staff within the government, which is a bad outcome for the American public. 

Employees under the proposal would serve at the discretion of the president, rather than being hired based on qualifications and experience alone. This would mean that employees could be hired or fired based on political loyalty rather than competence or expertise. This would likely have negative effects on the quality of the American government by opening the door to politicization and patronage throughout the federal workforce. The U.S. has tried that once before and it led to corruption, mismanagement and mis-use of funds. That was why Congress established the career civil service in the first place. We should not be going backwards. 

Just because an employee works on policy-related matters should not make them an at-will government employee. Administrations already appoint political leaders in every Agency. Those political appointees then direct their Agencies to carry out the policy positions of the Administration. Political leaders are often not versed in all the policy ins and outs and lo...

I do not agree with this proposed directive. 
Career Federal Employees should not be subject to the whims of political tides, but should be valued for the experienced scientists and policy makers that they are. Federal Employees are held to the law and the rules of their agencies, and should only be removed for clearly fire-able offenses, just like other employees. The need to fire employees should be determined by those managing the employees, not political appointees who do not necessarily have sufficient professional experience and expertise. Politicians and elected officials with sufficient expertise should be able to make a case to agency managers if there is a concern about an employee&#039;s work, but the decision should be individual and not political. 
If the current review and appeal system is too onerous, Congress could tweak that process to be less onerous, while still providing protections for both the employees and the American people who depend on the work of Federal Agencies. However, moving whole slates of employees to a designation that removes their protections, because being fair &quot;takes too long&quot; is insufficient justification.

Virtually all work for the Federal Government could be &quot;policy influencing&quot; (E.G. A NPS trail manager could discover something out in the field, which when escalated up the chain of command result in a... [truncated]">Regarding:  Office of Personnel Management

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Employee performance has nothing to do with this proposed rule. Creating a climate wherein employees feel they serves &quot;at the will of the President&quot; is the opposite of the intention of the civil service, protected from political outcomes. No express loyalty pledge is required to create a climate of forced allegiance. This is yet another authoritarian move in violation of civil protections for our government workers.

This policy will return America to the spoils system where each new president fills thousands of federal jobs with their supporters. I learned about that system in history class: America already tried it, and it was detrimental to the functioning of our government. With each new president, we lost institutional knowledge and experience throughout the government. This is why we have a civil service in the first place, so that partisan appointees would be replaced with skilled, qualified nonpartisan employees. The corruption and inefficiency resulting from the patronage system is why civil service reform was a major issue in the late 19th century. Why would we ever want to move in the opposite direction?">Agency name: OPM

This proposed rulemaking is titled &quot;Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,&quot; but it should not survive judicial review because it violates at least sections 706(2)A), (D), and (F) of the Administrative  Procedure Act (APA):
The reviewing court shall--

(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be--
(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;
* * *
(D) without observance of procedure required by law;

or
(F) unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.

When reviewing agency action under the &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; standard under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), reviewing courts should not always substitute their judgment for the agency&#039;s judgment.  However, reviewing courts should always instead determine whether (1) the agency in question has actually considered the relevant data and (2) stated a satisfactory explanation for its action, including whether the agency has made a legally sufficient showing in its explanation of a rational connection between the facts found by the agency and the choice made by the agency.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

For too long, unelected career bureaucrats in the federal government have stifled efficiency by undermining the plans and policies of the Chief Executive.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

I strongly oppose the implementation of Schedule F. Civil service protections exist to ensure federal employees can perform their duties free from political influence or retaliation. This proposed rule risks compromising our public institutions&#039; neutrality, expertise, and effectiveness by allowing positions to be filled based on political affiliation rather than professional qualifications or scientific expertise.

Currently, based on 42 U.S.C. 284, the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is the only political appointee at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Such a change would increase turnover, disrupt long-term strategic planning, and significantly hinder the agency&#039;s ability to execute its mission effectively.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to any reimplementation of policies analogous to “Schedule F” within the federal civil service, as contemplated by the proposed rule titled “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (Federal Register Document Number: 2025-06904).
The creation of Schedule F under Executive Order 13957 in 2020 posed a fundamental threat to the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce. By allowing broad reclassification of career civil servants involved in “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” roles, Schedule F sought to erode the essential distinction between nonpartisan expertise and political loyalty. This undermines both the stability and effectiveness of government operations and threatens the impartiality and professionalism that are hallmarks of our civil service.
Although the stated intent of the current rule proposal is to enhance responsiveness and accountability, reintroducing policies that echo Schedule F would achieve the opposite. Such a move would inject instability into public institutions by fostering political interference in roles that should remain nonpartisan. It would open the door to mass dismissal of qualified professionals based on political considerations, weaken institutional memory, and diminish public trust in government agencies.
Moreover, the civil service already has mechanisms in place for performance management and... [truncated]">

Career civil servants play a critical role in maintaining the continuity, stability, and institutional knowledge necessary for the reliable management of federal agencies. Their expertise and commitment enable them to faithfully implement laws and administer grants and contracts across differing administrations. If dismissal becomes easier and positions are opened to more political influence, it would undermine the nonpartisan character of the civil service, put the integrity of federal research funding at risk, and diminish public trust in government decision-making.

Moreover, the proposed changes raise concerns about the potential for ideologically driven or discriminatory policies to be imposed, including those based on religious beliefs.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.

1) Grantmaking is designed to be politically insulated: Unlike policymaking, which involves value judgments and political negotiations, federal grantmaking is governed by statutes, regulations, and peer review protocols that aim to shield it from partisan influence. Grant officers and reviewers apply established criteria to promote fairness, equity, and merit—not political objectives. 
2) The social effects of grant-based scientific work unfolds slowly, indirectly, and neutrally: The legitimacy of the federal grant system depends on transparency, predictability, and fidelity to review processes. Political interference in grant decisions, under the guise of “policymaking,” threatens any consistency and can destabilize the trust and planning horizons of research institutions, nonprofits, and local governments. These effects are agnostic to economic and social trends that flow with political impacts. 
3) Grantmaking is built around consistency: Policymaking often requires rapid responses to emerging issues and yields immediate legal or regulatory change. In contrast, grantmaking decisions—especially in science, health, or education—are cumulative, emergent, and long-term. Grantmaking supports discovery and capacity building, not instantaneous shifts in public behavior or institutional norms. These results have significant long-term impacts that extend b...

The intention of these proposed regulations seems to be a strong desire to &quot;return&quot; to a &quot;lost&quot; meritocracy by making hundreds of thousands of career civil servants (with the associated protections afforded to them) at-will employees, able to be fired on a moment&#039;s notice (aka, Schedule F).  

The desire for this scenario is a blatant misunderstanding of both the structure of -- and the NEED FOR the structure of -- the civil service, being perpetrated by a group of individuals whose only real understanding of work structure is the world of commercial business.  

Career civil servants have always been meant to be the machine operating in the background of public-facing politics, keeping essential government functions stable and uninterrupted, no matter which way the political winds blow.

This proposal seeks to trample that stable structure to one of constant instability, constant turnover, and deep partisan influence.  What sort of &quot;accountability&quot; exists if promotions are being awarded based on loyalty to a person or party, versus the quality of the employee&#039;s work or qualifications?  It&#039;s the exact OPPOSITE of what the stated goals are.

Career employees are as accountable as career civil servants have always and should always be.  They are held accountable through performance reviews and productivity matrices through their chain of command, and underperforming personnel are given an opportunity to correct course before adverse action is taken against them.

Below are reasons why implementing this proposed rule would cause great harm to the federal workforce, to current and future Administrations, and to the American people. 
1) Solution does not address the root problem
Schedule Policy/Career does not effectively address the core challenge reported by agency supervisors that removing employees for poor performance or misconduct in removing career federal staff. There is no evidence that policy-influencing positions are more likely to have performance or misconduct issues. OPM would be well-served to propose solutions that are rooted in evidence as effective. For example, consider a proposed removal of all federal employees who received a 2/5 annual performance rating in the past 3 years. Removing these employees in one fell swoop would overcome any litigation risk currently preventing supervisors from removing these employees on an individual basis. There are other interventions greatly needed to address the small but legitimate challenge of poor performers remaining on the federal payroll. 
2) Insufficient evidence of ideological obstruction among career federal staff

I strongly oppose the proposed rule to reestablish a Schedule F classification within the federal civil service. While it is framed as a way to improve accountability and responsiveness, it poses serious legal, constitutional, and policy concerns that threaten the integrity of the merit-based, nonpartisan federal workforce.

Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978

The Civil Service Reform Act was enacted to ensure that hiring and firing decisions are made based on merit, not political affiliation. This rule would allow broad reclassification and termination of employees without due process protections guaranteed under Title 5. Such actions undermine the very principles Congress intended to preserve and may exceed the executive branch’s legal authority.

Due Process Concerns

Employees gain a property interest in continued employment when protected by statute or regulation. Stripping those protections without individualized review violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process. This concern is especially acute for employees reclassified without consent into a category that removes appeal rights and procedural safeguards.

Arbitrary and Capricious Rulemaking

This rule lacks a rational basis for overturning long-standing protections. The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to consider reliance interests and provide a sound ju...

Technical and scientific experts within the federal government play a critical role in informing policy, guiding public health initiatives, supporting national security, and ensuring evidence-based decision-making. These professionals are hired for their expertise, training, and commitment to scientific integrity, not for their political affiliations or loyalty to any administration or ideology. Subjecting them to politicizing or loyalty tests undermines the very foundation of objective governance and endangers the nation’s ability to respond effectively to crises and long-term challenges.

First and foremost, the core principle of science and technical expertise is objectivity. Scientists, engineers, analysts, and other experts rely on empirical evidence, peer-reviewed data, and proven methodologies. Their work is governed by facts, not opinions or political leanings. When loyalty tests or political vetting enter the equation, it creates a chilling effect: experts may feel pressured to alter findings, suppress inconvenient truths, or distort analyses to align with political narratives. This not only diminishes the credibility of governmental research but also erodes public trust in federal institutions. The politicization of expertise during the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, led to widespread misinformation, conflicting messages, and ultima...

This proposal poses a direct threat to the merit-based civil service system that has safeguarded a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

Schedule F undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to end the spoils system by establishing merit-based hiring. Reclassifying a broad group of policy-related civil servants to make them easily terminable without cause invites politically motivated employment decisions. This contradicts the core principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which requires federal employment to be based on merit, not politics.

The proposal also violates due process protections under 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which ensures cause-based removals and procedural safeguards for career employees. Removing these protections for thousands of workers would erode accountability, silence expert dissent, and weaken the effectiveness of government agencies.

Furthermore, the Office of Personnel Management is statutorily obligated under 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles. Schedule F contradicts that mission, exposing career professionals to undue political pressure and disrupting the continuity of government programs.

In short, Schedule F endangers the integrity, independence, and legal foundations of the federal civil service. I urge the administration and th...

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Serviceˮ Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 

Dear Office of Personnel Management: 

I am submitting these comments regarding OPM’s Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Serviceˮ 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I oppose the Proposed “Schedule Policy/Career” Rule because it rescinds civil servant employment protections, fundamentally alters the nature of career civil servants at federal agencies, and places unnecessary and undesirable political pressure on career professionals serving in government.

Periodically over the past 13 years, I have served in various roles in two executive branch agencies and within the Executive Office of the President – as a fellow, temporary civil servant, and political appointee.  These jobs have allowed me to work across policy topics, with various levels and types of U.S. government employees, and on different types of policy work occurring within the executive branch.  I have seen the challenges of government and its bureaucracy, and I have seen the benefits.  

Based on this experience, I have deep concerns about this proposed rule, which would effectively convert a large swath of the non-partisan career federal workforce that is accountable to their oath to the Constitution to one that is accountable to ... [truncated]">May 23, 2025

Studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.

Re: 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752
[Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004]
RIN 3206-AO80

Civil service needs to be protected to stop the politicization of the day-to-day workforce and to prevent that most of the federal government would routinely overturn with each change in administration. Returning to that method is ripe for corruption as the civil service becomes a hotbed of political appointees beholden only to the one who hired them. 

When applied to the scientific branches, we will end up with a completely political system that will not only affect the workers (as they are routinely fired for newer, more politically &quot;friendly&quot; employees) but also the entirety of the funding process as political employees will inject politics into the grant-making process. I came to the US thirty years ago as an established neuroscientist because I admired the American system where grants are awarded based on reviewing by study sections. Because the study sections consist of the best scientists in the field, and because the service officials are unbiased, this method yields the best scientific results. I know how research funds are awarded in Germany and Switzerland which do not have study sections comparable to those of the NIH. Like the US, Germany spends a lot of money on medical research, but does not get as much good science for the buck as the US. American science is world class because of the quality of the review process.

I urge the Office of Personnel Management in the strongest possible terms not to go through with this proposed rule. Politicizing grantmaking positions at NIH and other research-funding agencies would be catastrophic for the prosperity of science in the US and for the long-term health of citizens.

Below, I explain two major reasons why this proposed rule would be so disastrous:
(1) A lack of dependably stable, long-term funding will reduce scientific innovation.
(2) Politicizing NIH will degrade the scientific integrity of research done in the US.

(1) The importance of stable, long-term funding:
Scientific research requires long, steady investment. It can take years to get a new experiment working, let alone to collect data and turn that data into a useful finding that advances the field. Especially for major incurable diseases of our time—like Alzheimer&#039;s, Parkinson&#039;s, and various types of cancer—breakthroughs in finding a cure require decades of fundamental research into understanding the biological mechanisms of the disease, followed by years more research to find effective treatments.

A recent study has shown that science is most innovative when labs are given the opportunity to dive deep into a narrow topic for a long time: https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/10.1007/s11192-025-05295-1

One of the great strengths of publicly funded research in the United States is that decisions to fund research are based on objective review processes.  These processes that have been established by Federal agencies and institutes such as the NIH and NSF without political interference  have been critical in generating science that has led to new treatments and cures. 

The proposed new regulation would result in the reclassification of all NIH Institute and Center Directors as well as Institute Division Directors as political appointees and thereby dramatically politicize NIH and increase the turnover of key positions.  This action limits important longer-term planning. In addition, this proposed new regulation would insert political interference into the research grant assessment and award process.  It would destroy the scientific integrity of the federal grant award process and devastate the most successful biomedical research program in the world.  This action would prevent the development of new cures and treatments for cancers and other diseases that adversely affect the health of Americans. This proposal will make America less healthy.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implemen...

Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

According to the Congressional Research Service,* this proposed rule could reclassify approximately 11,910 senior-level DOD employees — including 3,300 from the Army, 3,112 from the Navy, 1,592 from the Air Force, and 3,906 from other DOD entities — as at-will political appointees.

These civilian leaders are indispensable to strategic planning, weapons systems acquisition, cyber operations, logistics management, and the development of warfighting doctrine—domains where consistent expertise and impartial judgment are critical.

Indeed, making civil servants accountable to the President instead of to the people through their elected representatives will destroy true accountability.">This proposed change is contrary to the interests of the people of the United States of America. We protect our career civil servants from political pressure by keeping them accountable to the law and the constitution, not to the whims of whichever President happens to be elected at any time.

Here are some key reasons why it’s viewed negatively by many:

1. Undermines Civil Service Protections
Schedule F allows for the reclassification of federal employees in policy-related positions, stripping them of many traditional civil service protections—like due process before termination. This means employees could be fired more easily, potentially for political reasons rather than performance.

2. Threatens Nonpartisan Expertise
Federal employees are expected to serve administrations of both parties with nonpartisan expertise. Schedule F opens the door to politicizing roles that should remain impartial, possibly filling them with political loyalists instead of qualified professionals.

3. Creates Job Insecurity
With fewer protections, federal workers may be more hesitant to express concerns or dissent on policy matters. This could lead to self-censorship or fear of retaliation, undermining the integrity and openness that good governance requires.

4. Risks Brain Drain
The instability and politicization could drive away experienced professionals from public service, making it harder to attract and retain top talent. Government agencies might lose institutional knowledge and continuity.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,”
Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

Dear Office of Personnel Management:
Dennis Jones submit(s) these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM)
Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed
Rule.
I am an average citizen who cannot believe that any rule change that permits the arbitrary political firing of civil servants would do anything but lead to greater incompetence in agencies that provide vital services to the American people. Federal law has long stated that civil servants must be hired, promoted, and retained based on merit and not political loyalty. Nothing good could come from this rule change; no savings, no gain in expertise, nothing. It is only for political reasons and arbitrary control and not based on any real need.">5/21/25

                                <td style="display: none;">The comment clearly expresses opposition to the proposed rule by indicating that allowing arbitrary political firings would undermine merit-based hiring and lead to incompetence in federal agencies. It also emphasizes the need for due process and protections for civil servants, aligning with the identified stances on these issues.</td>

1) Agency employees should be loyal to the USA, not a political party or Presidential administration.
2)Agency employees should be motivated to serve the needs of the American public, not a political party or any particular Presidential administration. 
3) Our country should offer federal employment that attracts highly capable people and encourage their continuing professional competence by offering the opportunity for longevity in employment. If they are subject to termination each time there is a Presidential transition, it makes it difficult for career-minded employees to plan their lives, including buying a home, employment of spouses, and consistency in education for their children.
4) Those whose party is in power today should ask themselves whether they would be for this rule when that flips. 
5) We should embrace meritocracy, not political cronyism. 
6) Federal employees are workers who need the protection of federal civil service systems.

Let’s call this what it is: an attempt to bring loyalty tests into the heart of our civil service. Not loyalty to the Constitution, not to the law, not to ethical service—but to the will of whoever holds the White House. We feared this moment would come. Now it&#039;s here. This rule doesn&#039;t just open the door to authoritarianism—it throws it off the hinges. 

We’ve already seen what happens when a president demands obedience over truth. Public health was distorted. Law enforcement was manipulated. Inspectors general were removed. Intelligence was politicized. Civil servants who tried to uphold the law were smeared, exiled, or fired—not for wrongdoing, but for daring to resist unlawful directives. This rule would make all of that easier, faster, and permanent. 

We are not talking about a few political appointees. We are talking about the mass conversion of tens of thousands of apolitical, expert public servants into expendable loyalists. This is a roadmap to purge dissent, cripple oversight, and remake the federal workforce into a tool of personal power. 

And here’s what terrifies me: It will work. Legal analysis, agency resistance, statutory procedure—none of that will matter if people are too afraid to speak up, if every economist, scientist, lawyer, analyst, and regulator knows their job is ...

As a former federal employee, it has been my experience that people hired as a personal, political, or fraternal favor have demonstrated the following: 
They are less motivated to perform;
They are promoted and paid at a level they are not qualified for;
They do not have basic institutional knowledge and cannot interact effectively;
They do not have the requisite critical thinking skills;
They do not have the type of management experience that applies to the mission of the agency;
They are more likely to apply personal biases;
They are generally perceived with suspicion for underlying agenda or favoritism that is antithetical to the mission of the agency;
They are less meticulous in following policy, rules, regulations, and laws, as they have a benefactor protecting them.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

As a retired director of an engineering team in the private sector this change concerns me. 

Over my 40 year career I saw several changes at the top of my company. Not surprisingly the new leader would often bring new people in to lead the various parts of the company in order to ensure that the leader had people in place who believed in and supported any directional change the leader was looking to undertake. These changes would at times change the projects with which we were involved. We adapted to a new direction as requested and this was aided by the middle management leaders who knew the skills of their people. If the middle management leaders were also changed it would take them some time to learn the skill sets and abilities of their people before much forward progress in the new direction could be made. 

This all causes me concern with our federal government potentially losing this level of leadership and direction with a new administration and I urge you not to make this change.

Thank you for considering my thoughts.

The Pendleton Act  of 1883 specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations. 

People perform better in their jobs when their knowledge and expertise are acknowledged, when their progress towards goals is measured through established performance metrics, and when they are trusted and respected.  A system where only loyalty is rewarded and where all employees serve &#039;at will&#039; is much worse for employees and the country. This is not my opinion but the basis for the Pendleton Act, which remains the law of the land.

I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule that would reclassify key NIH scientific leadership positions as political appointments. This change poses a grave risk to the integrity and independence of the NIH and its mission to support scientific research for the public good.

The NIH is one of the most respected scientific institutions in the world precisely because it has historically been guided by scientific expertise, long-term vision, and rigorous peer review—*not* partisan ideology. Making senior NIH leadership political appointees will inject bias into the decision-making process, threaten the objectivity of funding allocations, and undermine public trust in the agency. It will shift NIH leadership from being accountable to scientific evidence and public health needs to being beholden to the priorities of transient political administrations.

This change would also severely hamper NIH’s ability to pursue long-term scientific initiatives. Meaningful biomedical research requires years—often decades—of stable, strategic investment. Politicizing leadership roles introduces instability, as each new administration could replace NIH leaders with individuals whose agendas may reflect political expediency rather than scientific merit. This turnover would disrupt continuity in funding priorities, strategic planning, and the stewardship of large-scale scientific efforts.

The NIH must remain grounded in evidence-based decision-making, gui... [truncated]">Opposition to Schedule F.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

The proposed rule would amount to returning to that system of political patronage instead of hiring practices based on merit and expertise. History has taught us that political considerations should never be allowed to influence hiring, firing, or classification of government employees.as it invites corruption, diminishes the quality of public services, and ultimately harms citizens.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

This new regulation would result in the reclassification of all NIH institute and center directors as political appointees and, thereby, dramatically politicize NIH and increase the turnover of key positions. This will limit long-term planning and execution of biomedical research. Such long-term planning is critical for the basic and clinical research that leads to treatments and cures.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Public Comment on OPM-2025-0004-0001: Why Are We Rebooting the Spoils System

Let me get this straight: OPM wants to bring back a system where federal employees can be fired just for doing their jobs too well—if those jobs involve saying no to a politician. That is not modernization. That is regression. This entire proposal, Schedule Policy/Career, is the bureaucratic version of sticking a fork into a light socket and pretending it is innovative.

Let us break this down.

The idea is to fire policy-influencing employees more easily. Sounds harmless until you remember: nearly every expert in government influences policy. That includes economists, cybersecurity specialists, scientists, bank examiners, engineers, public health analysts, and every person who has ever said Actually, sir, that would violate federal law. Under this rule, those people can be fired for lack of loyalty or subverting presidential direction. Translation: disagreeing with someone politically appointed, even when they are right.

Before 1883, government jobs were handed out as political favors. We called it the spoils system, because every time a new president came in, they fired everyone and replaced them with loyalists—regardless of whether they had any clue what they were doing. This is how we end...

To bring back Schedule F would be to invite partisanship into the heart of our federal workforce. It would strip away long-standing civil service protections from countless public servants, refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals who have devoted their lives to protecting our shared natural heritage. These individuals serve not for politics, but for purpose. Their work is rooted in science, guided by law, and driven by a quiet, steadfast commitment to the public good.

The National Wildlife Refuge System is already in a fragile state. Since the beginning of 2025 alone, we’ve lost over 20% of the remaining staff, this on top of a 30% decline over the last decade and a half. Many refuges now stand silent, with nearly one in ten lacking even a single staff member. Not a single refuge has what it needs to thrive. To impose Schedule F now would be a blow from which the conservation workforce might not recover.

This rule would hand political appointees the power to dismiss experts without cause, opening the door for replacements chosen not for their wisdom or experience, but for their political alignment. That is not reform. It is a dismantling. A weakening of the very fabric of public service. And it threatens the trust the American people place in those who care for our public lands.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

The proposal creates significant challenges to the core principles of a merit-based civil service. Reclassification of positions into Schedule Policy/Career without traditional civil service protections allows for politicization of roles that operate in a nonpartisan manner. This undermines the impartiality and expertise essential to effective governance.

The policy permits agencies to reclassify positions without notifying affected employees nor does it provide avenues for appeal. This absence of transparency and due process compromises employee rights and negatively impacts morale and trust. 

Eliminating procedural safeguards will lead to politicization of positions that influence policy. This results in decisions driven by political considerations rather than objective analysis and expertise. This will also lead to perpetual waste of taxpayer funds due to forced turnover occurring with each new administration and firing of at will workers owing to shifting priorities. 

Given the aforementioned concerns, I recommend that OPM withdraw the proposed rule. Upholding the nonpartisan, merit-based principles of the civil service is necessary for maintaining public trust and ensuring the continued effectiveness of government operations and good stewardship of taxpayer dollars for this administration and beyond.

This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.

The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.

While misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with &quot;undermining the democratic process&quot; sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.

The American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution—not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.

2. Jeopardize National Security - remove career experts from key security and diplomatic roles weakening preparedness and undermining strategic continuity,

I believe the proposed change is inimical to the preservation of a government of the people, by the people, for the people.  Since the mid 20th century, the integrity, independence, and professionalism of the federal civil service has been the bedrock of democracy and helped foster trust in government and in a state that provides for all of its citizens.  In eroding the merit-based civil service, the proposed regulation would invite undue political interference, violate longstanding statutory and constitutional protections, and threaten the rule of law.  Merit System Protections have helped to ensure a competitive hiring process based on employees&#039; qualifications, not their political loyalty to the executive branch.  Just-cause dismissals are already allowed for career civil servants.  Eliminating existing protections would violate the due process rights of federal employees, and erode bureaucratic neutrality and meritocracy (in the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and Title 5 of the U.S. Code) that have long contributed to our country&#039;s economic prosperity and political stability.  It would force career civil servants to carry out their duties in accordance with the political objectives of their superiors, rather than in the public interest. This contradicts the very idea of a nonpartisan civil service embodied in the Hatch Act.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

This plan jeopardizes the civil service system&#039;s foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.



Implementing Schedule F would lead to politicized employment decisions, contradicting the law&#039;s requirement for apolitical civil service. The broad and unclear criteria for Schedule F would also undermine due process rights, violating 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which demands cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Depriving thousands of workers of these protections would harm accountability and might silence experts, ultimately reducing government efficiency.



The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory obligation to protect the merit system under federal law (5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.).

  I oppose implementing Schedule Policy/Career. There is no need for additional political positions as there are already too many. Career Federal employees work in the best interests of American citizens regardless of the political party in power. Changes to administrations do not affect the work for which Federal employee were hired.  Changing career positions to political, at-will positions will only make projects and work harder to complete and cost the taxpayer more money due to changing priorities as administrations change. 
  Although the proposed rule states that these positions will be filled on a nonpartisan basis, the underlying goal is to hire people who will pledge loyalty to the President instead of to the Constitution as current Career Federal employees do. ">In regard to proposed rule by OPM

While accountability is a worthy goal, this proposal dangerously undermines the nonpartisan foundation of the federal workforce. The ability to remove employees without due process or the opportunity to appeal opens the door to political purges and the replacement of qualified, experienced public servants with partisan loyalists. This is not accountability—it is politicization.

The current protections exist to ensure that civil servants can perform their duties based on law, science, and policy—not on political loyalty. By turning policy-influencing positions into at-will roles, this rule would erode the professional independence of the federal workforce, chill dissent, and discourage talented individuals from public service. It would also create instability in government operations, as employees could be removed arbitrarily with each change in administration.

Moreover, labeling employees who do not align with &quot;Presidential directives&quot; as undermining the democratic process is a deeply troubling standard.

As a clinical psychologist dedicated to federally funded research on substance use and its impact on families, I witness daily the profound difference that evidence-based interventions make in saving lives. It is from this critical vantage point that I offer my public comment on the proposed government process changes.
The Imperative of Non-Partisan Science:
It is deeply concerning to observe a perception that grant-making is synonymous with policy-making. This misunderstanding threatens the very foundation of scientific progress. The singular goal of grant-making is to foster work that expands our scientific knowledge. Consequently, grants must be reviewed and funded solely on the merit and potential of the proposed science. Science, by its very nature, is non-partisan and non-political; its pursuit of truth should never be swayed by shifting political winds.
Protecting Our Nation&#039;s Scientific Workforce:
The bedrock of our federal scientific enterprise lies in the civil service protection that has safeguarded generations of dedicated, non-partisan workers committed to serving our country. If job security within these vital roles becomes contingent on the views and whims of political factions, we will inevitably fail to recruit and retain the best, most unbiased minds to conduct critical research and manage funding agencies.

Schedule F represents a profound threat to the integrity of the U.S. government by undermining merit-based hiring, due process, and the apolitical nature of the federal workforce.

1. Undermines the Merit System
Schedule F would enable the removal or reassignment of career federal workers without cause, reviving a spoils system the Pendleton Act of 1883 sought to end. By bypassing competitive hiring and performance-based promotion, this proposal compromises both fairness and efficiency across government agencies.

2. Violates Due Process
Federal employees in the competitive service have constitutionally recognized due process rights. Arbitrarily stripping them of those rights by reclassifying positions into Schedule F may violate the Fifth Amendment and contravenes decisions like Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill (1985), which recognized a property interest in continued employment.

3. Politicizes Public Service
Schedule F opens the door to political litmus tests for civil servants, potentially silencing dissent and discouraging employees from offering honest, expert advice. This erosion of neutrality directly conflicts with the Hatch Act’s goal of maintaining a nonpartisan civil service, and would cause long-term harm to the country’s institutional knowledge and democratic norms.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

I firmly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken competitive hiring protections for career federal employees. These safeguards exist to ensure that federal positions are filled based on merit—not political affiliation or ideology. Dismantling this system risks politicizing the civil service, undermining the impartiality and professionalism that are vital to effective governance.

Career civil servants form the foundation of our federal agencies, providing expertise, stability, and continuity through transitions between administrations. They are not political appointees but dedicated professionals who implement the law and serve the public, regardless of which party holds power. Easing dismissal standards and enabling their replacement with politically loyal individuals would erode public trust and compromise the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

1)	Career-Policy (updated schedule F) would greatly expand, by virtue of vague job titles, the number of people classified as policy-influencing, even when their “policy job” only involves impact analysis after a policy is already passed and implemented, sometimes decades later. This change will negatively impact thousands of GS 12 and GS 13 employees, who can’t even tell the GS-11 in the next cube what to do, let alone make policy decisions. 
2)	Monitoring of these employees is more costly and cumbersome than it’s worth.  You might be able to get rid of a few bad performers, but you’d still have to pay an army of compliance officers, who would probably make more money than the people they’d be monitoring. 
3)	A PMAP (employee evaluation) may look objective, but managers vary a lot. An “outstanding” in one division may be “meets expectations” elsewhere, and vice versa.  People who would be more effective and efficient by transferring would simply be let go, adding on the cost of onboarding a new staffer. 
4)	The constant churn of employees via “at will employment” or “almost political appointment” creates inefficiencies of its own, as institutional knowledge is lost when the administration changes.  This could be true even if the party of the incoming president is the same.

This proposal threatens the foundational principles of a nonpartisan, expert-driven civil service and endangers the integrity of federal grantmaking—particularly within scientific agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The proposed rule&#039;s language explicitly targets individuals involved in discretionary aspects of grantmaking, including drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating applications, and selecting recipients. These tasks require deep scientific expertise, rigorous peer review, and adherence to evidence-based standards—not political alignment. Reclassifying these roles as political appointments will severely undermine the objectivity and credibility of federal funding decisions.
Of particular concern is the reported plan to make all NIH Institute and Center Directors political appointees. This would dismantle long-term planning and erode public trust in the NIH, which has historically functioned as an independent, world-leading scientific institution. Scientific discovery and public health innovation require stability, continuity, and freedom from political influence.

No human endeavor is perfect, but America’s civil service is certainly no less perfect than the best corporate workplaces (where I’ve also worked).  
The proposed rules change “to increase career employee accountability” by reclassifying career civil servant positions as Schedule Policy/Career in order to “increase career employee accountability” appears to be an effort to subjugate federal employees to the whims of the administration.  Such a change is the polar opposite of what is needed to have an effective, independent civil service capable of performing the duty of serving the American people, regardless of who is in the White House or the halls of Congress.  At best, this rules change is a misguided overreaction and would cause far more harm than good.  
In the interest of an effective and reasonably efficient civil service, please reject this proposal.

This rule is a direct threat to the integrity of science-based governance and would severely undermine the mission-driven work carried out by public servants across federal agencies.

I entered public service because I believe that science, data, and evidence must inform policy decisions—especially when lives, resources, and the environment are at stake. The proposed rule jeopardizes this foundation by granting political leadership sweeping power to reclassify technical experts into an at-will employment status, stripping them of civil service protections and leaving them vulnerable to political pressure or termination for doing nothing more than reporting objective facts.

Whether one works on climate modeling, food safety, infrastructure resilience, public health, or cybersecurity, the message from this rule is clear: your job is secure only as long as your expertise does not inconvenience political leadership. That is not just demoralizing—it’s dangerous.

Public trust in government relies on the idea that our agencies are staffed with professionals whose work is guided by facts, not political expediency. Under this rule, that trust will erode.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

1. Threat to Nonpartisan Governance
Schedule F poses a serious threat to the foundational principle of a nonpartisan civil service. By allowing the reclassification of tens of thousands of federal workers into a new category—stripping them of civil service protections—Schedule F opens the door for hiring and firing decisions based on political loyalty rather than professional competence. This erodes the impartial execution of laws, turning expert policy advisors into political appointees.

2. Destabilization of Institutional Knowledge
The U.S. federal government relies on experienced civil servants who carry institutional memory, technical expertise, and a deep understanding of complex regulatory systems. Schedule F would lead to mass firings and resignations of career professionals, disrupting continuity in governance and weakening the government&#039;s ability to respond to crises with informed, steady leadership.

3. Chilling Effect on Dissent and Honest Advice
Removing job protections discourages federal employees from offering candid, evidence-based advice—especially when that advice may conflict with political narratives. This silencing of expertise not only weakens decision-making but can also contribute to policy failures, particularly in areas such as public health, national security, and environmental protection.

As the wife of a career federal employee I oppose this rule. I am concerned about what it would mean if people dedicated to their particular field of work for the government, often because of their specific education and experiences, are replaced with people simply because they align politically with the administration. This does not bode well for highly important research, continuity of that research, and job security. Culture of the workplace is critical as well to retention. If workers do not feel they are valued or have rights to challenge termination or reclassification this will lead to less loyalty in the long run. My husband is in the field of wildland fire and as a first responder in often dangerous situations, we hope that the research (for example out of the US forest Service Missoula Fire Science Lab) about firefighter safety in relation to fire shelter effectiveness and toxins exposure is not interrupted or halted for the long term physical and mental well being of our family. I trust that the folks currently hired and working in this field are there for their genuine passion and care in this field. I worry this new policy would continue allowing the administration to fire people doing this critical work and we need experts, not politically motivated appointees.  ">

It will also be difficult to find people to work for low wages and difficult conditions, if they know their job at most will last four years, eight if they are lucky.

Meanwhile, we show up every day and work hard to keep vital systems running, even now while our livelihoods are being threatened.

I work on drafting and defending policies that improve and maintain clean air for all Americans and future generations. This work -- and most of the work of many agencies -- does not create any sort of profit. It is not meant to. The very function of government is to provide services and to regulate resources and commons for all to enjoy, outside of profit creation. This work is vital for all of those reasons. My work is also grounded in objective scientific evidence, guided by public health facts, and helps everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. The ability to carry out these essential government functions depends on a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service that values expertise, insulates scientific processes from political pressure, and prioritizes helping our environment and our people in any administration.

Schedule F would eliminate civil service protections for tens of thousands of career experts, allowing them to be removed based on political loyalty rather than job performance. This does not enhance accountability—it replaces evidence-based decision-making with political patronage.

True accountability in government arises from clear performance standards, due process, and expertise, not from the ability to purge qualified professionals who may disagree with political leadership. Similarly, democratic responsiveness does not mean substituting partisan preferences for nonpartisan, merit-based policy implementation, especially in areas like scientific research, where objectivity is essential.

If anything, Schedule F weakens the performance of the federal workforce by introducing instability, deterring talented professionals from public service, and making long-term planning nearly impossible.

I strongly oppose the proposed implementation of Schedule F, which would reclassify federal civil service positions with “substantive discretionary authority” over grantmaking as political appointees. This change would profoundly damage the integrity of the federal grantmaking process and erode the merit-based, peer-reviewed evaluation systems that ensure funding decisions are guided by scientific excellence rather than political ideology.

This proposal undermines the foundational principles of fairness, political neutrality, and meritocracy that are essential to a robust and effective civil service.

Historically, the United States has recognized the importance of a career civil service that operates independently of political pressures. The Pendleton Act of 1883 was a landmark reform that established a merit-based system for federal employment, ensuring that civil servants are selected based on their qualifications rather than political connections. This principle has been vital in maintaining a professional workforce that can implement policies consistently and impartially, regardless of the administration in power.

Career civil servants are tasked with executing the laws and policies enacted by Congress, not creating them. They operate within a legal framework designed to uphold the rule of law and protect the interests of the public. Allowing for the rapid termination of employees based on perceived disloyalty to Presidential directives threatens to create a culture of fear and compliance, where civil servants may feel pressured to prioritize political allegiance over their professional responsibilities.

The Act established a merit-based hiring process for federal employees who work on a bipartisan basis. Schedule F, instead, opens the door for politically motivated hiring and firing.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

As a federal employee submitting this comment in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose this proposed rule. This policy would bring an unprecedented level of politicization into the federal workforce and lead to harmful consequences for the American public. 

I work in health policy, specifically on one of the government health insurance programs. These programs represent a significant share of the federal budget and are enormously complex. As such, it can take years to develop the subject matter knowledge necessary to be an effective steward of a health insurance program’s policies and operations. 

If finalized, this rule will diminish the importance of expertise in favor of political loyalty and will lead to a less experienced workforce that is ill-equipped to run the health insurance programs that millions of Americans – regardless of political affiliation – rely on. As civil servants, we have a deep understanding of federal requirements and strong relationships across federal and external stakeholders in the health insurance ecosystem, neither of which can be easily replaced. 

While the rule’s summary strains to emphasize that positions would still be filled on a non-partisan basis, it is clear that the effect will be to remove employees who act in a manner considered to be in opposition to the current administration’s priorities. As a result, it will create a politicized federal workforce, which will be focused... [truncated]">Agency name: OPM

Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service
Posted by the Office of Personnel Management on Apr 22, 2025

The proposed rule change to establish Schedule Policy/Career raises several legal and ethical concerns. These concerns were often discussed in the context of prior rulemakings, particularly regarding the predecessor Schedule F, and the current proposed rule addresses and responds to them from the Office of Personnel Management&#039;s (OPM) updated perspective.
Here are some of the key legal and ethical concerns that require consideration before the enactment of the rule change
Legal Concerns:
Statutory Authority: A significant legal concern revolved around OPM&#039;s statutory authority, particularly under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), to extend chapter 75 adverse action procedures and appeals to employees whose positions are reclassified or transferred into policy-influencing excepted service schedules.  OPM&#039;s current proposed rule is partly based on the conclusion that its prior amendments in the April 2024 final rule, which purported to provide such protection for involuntarily moved incumbents, exceeded its statutory authority.  
Constitutionality: Commenters in prior rulemakings argued that Schedule F was unlawful, and OPM&#039;s prior views suggested legal error. 

Due Process: Concerns were raised regarding whether removing adverse action procedures for employees moved into policy-influencing positions would violate their con... [truncated]">Proposed Rule

Chett Hopkins submits these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM)
Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule

As a veteran of the US Army that is enrolled in the VA healthcare system I would like to express my concerns regarding the proposed reclassifying of US civil servants.  I feel that this rule is unwarranted and frankly dangerous.  The importance of having non-political civil servants should not be so casually swept aside.  The VA and other federal agencies serve vital rolls for the citizens of the United States. These civil servants work for the those citizens and not a presidential administration and therefore should be free from any political influence that could constrain them from providing the services that veterans and citizens like myself depend on. The proposed reclassification of the federal employees would also lend itself to creating a cronyism type of civil service which history as shown creates barriers to a fair and equitable U.S. government. Which in the case of VA healthcare could have life or death consequences for veterans who would be at the whim of a political appointee instead of an experienced, dedicated civil s...

* Promoting Merit and Expertise: A nonpartisan civil service ensures that individuals are hired and promoted based on their skills, qualifications, and experience rather than political connections or loyalties.
* Maintaining Impartiality and Fairness: Civil servants, who are responsible for implementing government policies and providing public services, should do so without bias or favoritism based on political views.
* Enhancing Trust and Confidence: A politically neutral civil service helps build public trust in the government&#039;s ability to act in the best interests of all citizens, regardless of their political affiliation.
* Ensuring Stability and Continuity: The longevity of career civil servants provides stability and institutional knowledge that helps government operations run smoothly across different administrations.
* Preventing Corruption and Cronyism: A merit-based system reduces the risk of corruption and the awarding of jobs or favors based on political patronage rather than qualifications.
* Supporting Effective Governance: Studies show that professional, nonpartisan civil service systems tend to perform better, with increased efficiency, higher worker motivation, and less corruption.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Subject: Public Comment Opposing “Schedule Policy/Career” Regulation

I write to oppose the proposed, titled Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service (Docket ID: OPM–2025–0004). This proposal for a new &quot;Schedule Policy/Career&quot; classification within the excepted service, is a direct threat to the democratic foundation of the U.S. civil service. 
Below are five critical reasons why this rule must be withdrawn:
1. Erosion of Due Process and Merit Protections
This rule would strip thousands of federal employees of their due process rights and protections under Title 5. They would become at-will employees, vulnerable to removal without cause or the right to appeal. This is antithetical to the merit-based foundation of the modern federal workforce. Federal law (5 U.S.C. § 2301) enshrines merit system principles that include selection and advancement based solely on &quot;ability, knowledge, and skills,&quot; and protection against &quot;arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.&quot;
This regulation stands in sharp contrast to this administration&#039;s own Executive Order on Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy (April 2025) while it enables removals based not on merit or performance, but on vague and subjective classifications of influence.
2. Politicization of the Civil Service

This policy threatens the foundation of a nonpartisan civil service by allowing political considerations to override merit-based hiring and job security.

Schedule P/C would enable positions traditionally held by career professionals to be filled based on political loyalty rather than qualifications. This undermines the integrity of the civil service and risks turning public servants into partisan actors—serving political agendas instead of the American people.

The impact on federal contracting would be particularly harmful. Contracting professionals oversee billions of taxpayer dollars across essential sectors including defense, healthcare, infrastructure, and emergency response. These roles demand deep institutional knowledge, strict adherence to procurement laws such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and consistent oversight to ensure accountability and value. Introducing politically driven turnover into this workforce creates unacceptable risk.

Developing acquisition professionals is a long-term investment. It requires years of formal training, rotational assignments, certifications, and continuous education. Political appointees lacking this expertise would compromise the integrity and effectiveness of the federal acquisition system.

The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.

As a practicing scientist I am particularly concerned how this will transform how our country funds science.  If all employees at the NIH, including NIH Institute Directors become at-will positions, it will transform scientific funding into a political process.

This plan jeopardizes the civil service system&#039;s foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.



Implementing Schedule F would lead to politicized employment decisions, contradicting the law&#039;s requirement for apolitical civil service. The broad and unclear criteria for Schedule F would also undermine due process rights, violating 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which demands cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Depriving thousands of workers of these protections would harm accountability and might silence experts, ultimately reducing government efficiency.



The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory obligation to protect the merit system under federal law (5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.). Introducing Schedule F would erode this duty by exposing career civil servants to inappropriate political pressure, ultimately weakening the consistency and professionalism of government programs.

The Schedule F initiative endangers fundamental principles of good governance, including an independent civil service and ...

Grant-making is not policy-making and it is concerning that it is viewed that way.  Grant-making has the goal of supporting work to increase scientific knowledge. Grants should be reviewed and funded based on the quality and potential of the science they propose. Science is non-partisan and non-political.  

Civil service protection has been in place for generations of non-partisan workers who are devoted to serving their country.  We will not be able to recruit the best, unbiased people to these roles if their job security depends on the views and whims of political factions.

American science is already handicapped by short-term appropriations, e.g., annual appropriations for the NIH, making it harder to fund long-term projects.  Scientific advances take time, often years.  The turnover produced by politicizing appointments at NIH and other funding agencies would be damaging.
Experience and expertise matter a great deal, and this approach risks bringing in people with insufficient experience and expertise to make good decisions. ">Re: Docket ID: OPM–2025–0004
