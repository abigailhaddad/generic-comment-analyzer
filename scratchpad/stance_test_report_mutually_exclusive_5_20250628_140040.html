There are many issues with this, but I can speak to how this would be a problem in the field of scientific research. As someone who works in academic research, I can see how the grant writing process works and that a granting organization such as the NIH, whose directors and PIs are not connected to the current administration, aims to fund strong science that will serve the people long term, regardless of the government’s aims. This not only ensures that scientists continue to discover truths about biology, chemistry, health or the physical world, but also invests in the long term well being of the public (for example, through discovery of therapeutic approaches). If those reviewing and creating grants are rapidly changing with every new administration, this would decrease scientists’ long term commitments to their fields of research and would undermine scientific integrity at large. Science would be subject to political interference, which would be a risk to the science itself.">This proposal would reclassify many government jobs as policy making positions, which puts those in those roles at risk of only serving the current political agenda and decreasing their effectiveness in their role.

              title="# Public Comment Opposing Proposed Schedule Policy/Career Rule

I strongly oppose OPM’s proposed “Schedule Policy/Career” rule, which fundamentally undermines the merit-based civil service system by removing due process protections from career employees while claiming they remain nonpartisan. The proposal creates an inherent contradiction—positions cannot be both truly nonpartisan and subject to at-will termination, as removing adverse action procedures eliminates the very safeguards that ensure decisions are based on merit rather than political considerations. This rule would chill honest professional advice from civil servants who fear summary dismissal for providing expert analysis that contradicts political preferences. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposal and instead strengthen existing performance management tools within the current merit-based framework that has served our nation for over a century."># Public Comment Opposing Proposed Schedule Policy/Career Rule

How can anyone build a career in the government, which we should want, if the most they can expect is 8 years developing their skills and climbing the ranks as generations before have done? It wasn&#x27;t just the Republican party, the Democrats also supported this change with thousands of pieces of legislation during the 20th century.
Undoing that now, to serve the whims of a president who cannot serve more than another 3 years is absurd, and scary given he forces government employees (who do not serve him) to write letters praising and pledging allegiance to a man... not our country.

RE: Proposed Rule – Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [OPM-2025-00041] 

Dear Acting Director Ezell:

Friends of Acadia submits this comment in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed rule to reinstate Schedule F or any similar attempt to strip civil service protections from career professionals in the National Park Service.

As a nonprofit, conservation organization dedicated to protecting Acadia National Park in the state of Maine, we are concerned that this proposed rule will have profound and far-reaching consequences not only on the professionals who steward our public lands, but also on the millions of Americans who depend on their experience and integrity. We believe the implementation of this rule would destabilize leadership across the National Parks Service (NPS), particularly among superintendents responsible for managing multi-million-dollar budgets, critical infrastructure projects, and complex personnel decisions.

A Workforce Already Under Duress

Since January 2025, the NPS has lost 12.5% of its full-time workforce due to mass attrition, voluntary retirements, and firings of probationary employees. Acadia alone is facing 54 unfillable vacancies due to the ongoing federal hiring freeze. Nationwide, more than 100 superintendent positions remain vacant, and seasonal hiring has...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213.

I found, and I believe they found, the relationship between political level employees and career civil service employees to be a mutually beneficial working relationship.

I am absolutely opposed to this change; this proposal will compromise the ability of civil service employees to do their jobs fairly and impartially, or it will replace them with underqualified individuals who have no business in these civil positions.

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.

Federal agencies depend on a workforce of skilled professionals with technical expertise and institutional knowledge. Classifying these employees as at-will not only jeopardizes their job security but also makes it far more difficult to attract and retain the high-caliber talent needed to deliver on essential missions in areas including public health, development, national security, and disaster response.

The work we do is not just technical, but deeply strategic, often requiring years of planning, continuity, and trusted relationships to yield results. Schedule F introduces instability that undermines this long-term investment and risks turning federal service into a revolving door of political appointees. That instability threatens to erode public trust in the civil service and reduce our capacity to respond to both domestic and global crises.

I urge the administration to abandon this rule and reaffirm its commitment to a professional, nonpartisan civil service.">I am commenting in my personal capacity.

This proposal threatens the foundational principles of a nonpartisan, expert-driven civil service and endangers the integrity of federal grantmaking—particularly within scientific agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The proposed rule&#x27;s language explicitly targets individuals involved in discretionary aspects of grantmaking, including drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating applications, and selecting recipients. These tasks require deep scientific expertise, rigorous peer review, and adherence to evidence-based standards—not political alignment. Reclassifying these roles as political appointments will severely undermine the objectivity and credibility of federal funding decisions.
Of particular concern is the reported plan to make all NIH Institute and Center Directors political appointees. This would dismantle long-term planning and erode public trust in the NIH, which has historically functioned as an independent, world-leading scientific institution. Scientific discovery and public health innovation require stability, continuity, and freedom from political influence. Replacing career scientists with politically motivated appointees will cause irreparable harm to our research infrastructure and international leadership.

The rigorous review process that researchers undergo has been key to this success.

This proposed new regulation would inject political interference into the research grant assessment and award process.  These changes will hinder and perhaps devastate the most successful research program in the world.

    2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

While the stated goals of accountability and democratic responsiveness are important, this rule, in its current form, poses significant risks to the integrity of the civil service and the principles of fairness and due process.

The removal of Chapter 43 and 75 protections, including Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeals, for a broad category of &quot;policy-influencing&quot; career employees is deeply concerning. This action would essentially create a system of at-will employment for a significant portion of the federal workforce, making them vulnerable to arbitrary or politically motivated removal without adequate recourse. The historical context provided in the proposed rule itself highlights the dangers of a purely patronage-based system, which this rule risks resurrecting in a new guise.

While the proposal claims to maintain nonpartisan hiring for Schedule Policy/Career positions, the lack of meaningful job security and appeal rights inherently politicizes these roles. Employees in these positions would be incentivized to align themselves with the political preferences of the current administration, rather than providing objective and expert advice based on their professional expertise and the best interests of the...

I strongly oppose the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, &quot;Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.&quot;

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.

The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.

While misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with &quot;undermining the democratic process&quot; sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.

The American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution—not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.

The proposed change would frame grantmaking as policy. Thus, those involved in grantmaking would be political appointees, and would influence the evaluation and awarding of grant funding according to the agenda of whichever President was in power.

Adopting this proposed change would have egregious consequences for our country&#x27;s ability to conduct world-leading scientific research and educate a competitive scientific workforce.

Instead, those involved in grantmaking should be nonpartisan, career civil servants with appropriate expertise and experience to write funding announcements, evaluate grant opportunities, and recommend grant funding to achieve the missions of their agencies.

Thus, the proposed change should be rejected.">&quot;Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

To do so, and to remove the current protections these positions are afforded, would allow removal of employees for dissenting opinions, civil disagreement, or other normal actions that should arise in policy-influencing positions. Such a change, classifying these individuals as at-will employees, would remove the necessary discourse required of such positions and would amount to groups of only like-minded individuals driving policy changes without appropriately weighing counter viewpoints. Not only will this change weaken the federal workforce protections but it will weaken the federal workforce, federal policy, and the entire federal system.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004”

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule. I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity  

I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements, oversee the review of grant applications, and assess the scientific literature and synthesize input from subject matter experts and public input (via request for information) to identify scientific priorities as Schedule F would politicize the NIH and its mission, degrade public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.

As a federal employee writing in my personal capacity, these proposed changes would make me fear providing my best judgment and feedback to leadership, for fear of retaliation.   

I believe this policy would also lead to a less efficient and more costly NIH by granting any incoming Administration the authority to replace existing employees with ones of their p... [truncated]">Office of Personnel Management

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

The rule would classify career federal employees with substantive responsibilities (the economists and the scientists) as holding confidential or policy-determining posts, opening them to being fired for any reason or no reason at all. In other words, it would dramatically expand the civil service exception intended for political officials to cover enormous swaths also of the nonpartisan federal workforce. 

Schedule F is not merely an affront to sound governance principles. It is unlawful.

The Civil Service Reform Act exempts “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” employees from its broad job protections. But that narrow exception is not a license for the President to reclassify and arbitrarily fire any federal employee who does meaningful work. On the contrary, those words have a specific, longstanding meaning—they refer to political appointees. Since the New Deal, reformers, Presidents, and legislators have exclusively used the confidential and policy-making designation to describe the sorts of senior officials who lead agencies and assist those leaders directly.
