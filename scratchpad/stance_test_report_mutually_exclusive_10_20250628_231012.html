Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

How utterly delightful to have an entirely new ACIP!
Thank you, to all of you, for undertaking what is probably a very onerous office, you folks are the true heroes of the day. 
I give thanks to God every single day for this massive, sweeping change in the public health regime. 

Just stick to your principles, keep the pressure and the intense scrutiny on vaccine safety, and we will win through to a great sea change in children&#039;s health and the health of all Americans. It is incredibly inspiring to see you gathered together as the new ACIP, and to feel the coming changes in the wind.

We live in stirring times!

Best regards

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I want to keep my family safe and ensure that they stay healthy throughout the year. As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence clearly indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important tools for addressing SARS-CoV-2. Universal access to updated COVID vaccines is needed to address the ongoing changes in variants. Additionally, vaccines must be recommended for individuals of all ages and be fully covered by public funds/or insurance at a regular interval of at least every six months.

I am very disappointed about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVI... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am a public school teacher that works with impoverished vulnerable children. I have dedicated my life to public service, and there are millions of us working in public facing jobs which are stressful on their own. Having to worry that we will contract a disease while at work that could at worst kill us, or at best keep us out of our jobs and away from the people we are trying to help while we are sick, is not in anybody’s best interest. This kind of anxiety should not be an added burden when there are scientifically backed measures we can take to lessen the risk. I also take care of my mother who is 90, and I have a sister who is immunocompromised. Not having access to vaccines doesn’t just put me at risk it puts my family at risk and all of the children I teach and their families at risk. I, and millions of other hard working Americans, should not have their right to choose to be vaccinated taken away.

More to the point, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and a...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Growing up, I distinctly remember a classmate contracting bacterial meningitis, a truly terrifying experience for our school community. The fear of what could have been, and the serious, long-term health complications she faced, left a lasting impression on me and my family. This experience deeply ingrained in me the life-saving power of vaccines. They aren&#039;t just medical interventions; they represent a critical shield of protection, ensuring that families don&#039;t have to endure such severe and potentially devastating illnesses. For me, vaccines are a cornerstone of public health, offering a future where preventable diseases no longer cast long shadows over our communities.

I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These independent scientists and clinicians played a crucial role in assessing the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved vaccines. They also guided insurance coverage, including for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

Vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are currently very low, leading to outbreaks of preventable illnesses like measles, pertussis, and COVID across the U.S. These infections can cause severe, lasting health consequences. No child in 2025 should suffer o... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RE: Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Dear Secretary Kennedy and Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),

I am writing as a concerned citizen with educational training and professional experience in public health as well as lived experience with Long Covid and other infection-associated chronic conditions.

I was deeply troubled by the Secretary’s abrupt termination of the ACIP members earlier this month. I share the concerns expressed by major physicians and public health groups like the American Medical Association and American Public Health Association that this will increase vaccine-preventable diseases–causing avoidable illness and deaths. For example, Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, called the committee a trusted source of science- and data-driven advice and said “Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.”

The Secretary’s action broke the promise he made during confirmation hearings, which undermines trust in his leadership. The committee was composed of qualified, thoughtful experts selected by a rigorous process. I fear their replacements do not live up to these standards. I suggest that the Secretary reads the article published by the former ACIP members in JAMA on June 16, 2025 (Asutrias et al).

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

The words I am about to say are rooted in science, logic, and a deep understanding of infectious disease and the healthcare system, as someone who is a cancer survivor and currently disabled. I fear for children, healthy people, and other vulnerable groups like myself, who may lose vaccine access under this current administration. It has been proven that vaccines prevent severe illness, and we all deserve to be able to access that tool of healthcare, whether we want to or not. Refusing to get vaccinated is a choice - not a mandate. And we should all be able to make that choice freely. If vaccine access is taken away, it will no longer be a choice. Lack of access is just as heavy-handed as mandating vaccines. The removal of choice is something I ask the Committee to consider carefully. Revoking this access puts cancer-survivors like me, my healthy family, my coworkers who have children, and many others at risk of death or lifelong health complications, as unvaccinated individuals have shown to have more severe outcomes after contracting COVID-19. Regardless of if the committee thinks COVID is still a threat to people (even though there is currently a strain called NB.1.8.1 giving everyone I know &quot;razor blade throat&quot;), I urge the committee to keep COVID vaccines universally accessible, so tha...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
Thank you for reading this. I am a concerned member of the public with a Master’s in Public Health; I have no financial stake nor conflicts of interests to disclose.
I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members had an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. They were intended as the ones providing guidance and guardrails; now those are gone.
Vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. It would be a devastating step back if, in 2025, children died or were disabled by infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Dr. Marty Makary, and Dr Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that would effectively limit access to COVID va... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Since covid levels are chronically high and, as a consequence, mutating rapidly, we are left with widespread health issues across the population, and the corresponding economic waste that comes from that, as well as vaccines that are poorly matched to the dominant strains in circulation. Maintaining universal access to vaccines for individuals 6 months of age and older helps with the former issue while leveraging mrna vaccines to update every 6 months helps address the latter.

We also know that covid is a year-round virus, with the cumulative health damage from infections being agnostic to the time of year, and the vaccine only provides 3-4 months of active immunity. I light of these points, we should suggest at least 2 vaccines a year for the two main covid waves and that especially vulnerable people like immunocompromised individuals should be able to get it every 2 months regardless of the degree to which they are immunocompromised.">Hello, my name is Brandon and I am writing this comment to advocate for universal access to the vaccine for individuals 6 months and up, more frequent updating of the vaccine, and more frequent vaccinations.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Vaccines for childhood diseases were not available when I was young, and I suffered long-term health consequences from a severe measles infection. I can remember being very ill and don&#039;t want children in 2025 to die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the p... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

My husband and I are both over 65 and have several chronic health conditions that put us at higher risk of serious consequences from Covid, the flu, RSV and other viruses. We rely on timely, updated, accessible vaccinations to participate fully in activities with lots of people (such as sporting events, concerts, cruises, etc.)and stay healthy.

My husband and I have no financial or other conflict of interest with the vaccination approval process. We expect ACIP members to disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest, for transparent government. 

Currently available FDA-approved vaccines have been proven safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people, who rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage. 

I urge ACIP to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US. Specifically, please make a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually. My husband and I have been getting COVID vaccines twice a year and have stayed healthy! 

Thank you for considering my comments. ">Thank you for taking my comment.

Please do your job…evaluate, listen, analyze, and consider what the science says about these “death shots” that so many people took without being informed about dangers or the fact that there were alternatives to staying healthy. They believed in your committee and the FDA to keep them safe, properly test, and give honest and truthful findings about products. NOT! 
So, I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

With such a huge number of vaccines on the agenda, now is the perfect time to emphasize the need for double-blind inert placebo studies on all vaccines before they can be brought to the market. This gold standard of scientific investigation has not been applied to vaccines on the routine childhood schedule.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express my concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and there are many outbreaks threatening the health of people across the country. Infectious diseases can cause serious lifelong consequences. Vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

Creating barriers to COVID vaccination is harmful to the public’s health.

We have seen study after study indicating that COVID has long-term health consequences even in healthy people with mild infections. Disabled people and immunocompromised people have been left behind more than anyone. People with Long COVID are tired of waiting for adequate treatments.

I am an allergist-immunologist who began my residency at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am submitting this comment not just as a physician, but as someone who took care of young patients in their thirties &amp; forties -- previously healthy -- who died from COVID-19, unvaccinated. These were people who weren&#039;t vulnerable by any metric we use. And they died anyway. Just like the 2 unvaccinated children in Texas that died earlier this year from Measles. Vaccines changed everything. Once the mRNA COVID vaccines became available, the tidal wave of deaths and ICU admissions began to recede. I will always support vaccines because I have seen firsthand what life -- and death -- look like without them. 

That&#039;s why I am deeply concerned about the recent appointments to the ACIP committee. Vaccine policy must be guided by data, integrity, and expertise -- not by members without adequate, relevant experience or (worse) people who have a hidden agenda to promote misinformation about vaccines. RFK has appointed at least 3 members with known anti-vaccine views (Retsef Levi, Vicky Pebsworth, and Martin Kulldorff). The other members have no relevant experience, whatsoever (Joseph Hibbeln, James Vincent Pagano, Michael Ross). RFK replaced 17 vaccine scientists (professionals in their field, with highly-specialized experience, extreme competence) with a lineup that&#039;s one part conspiracy convention, one part LinkedIn roulette. This needs to stop.

The replacement of the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices less than two weeks before this meeting removes continuity and creates uncertainty in the ability of the committee to accomplish its expressed agenda at this public meeting.
The original docket specified a range of vaccines to be considered, but how the draft published agenda at https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-18.pdf indicates the meeting will be shorter, and will only include a few vaccines: those for COVID, influenza, RSV, MMRV, anthrax, and Chikungunya. It will only include recommendation votes for influenza and RSV (maternal/pediatric, and Vaccines for Children) vaccines. Meaning there will be no recommendation votes and Vaccines for Children votes for COVID. It appears that the discussion of CMV, Lyme disease, and pneumococcal vaccines have been entirely removed from the agenda. In addition, the discussion and recommendation votes for HPV and meningococcal vaccines and the Vaccines for Children vote for HPV vaccine were entirely removed from the agenda.
My concern is that by removing these important discussions and votes in a public meeting is side-stepping the standard process for review and denying the transparency owed to the U.S. people regarding vaccine data, discussions, and decisions.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

One death is too many! I have a loved one who now has 14 life-threatening illnesses since his employer required vaccination to stay employed. He had no health problems before these vaccines. Now, he&#039;s fighting against the attorney general, labor and industries, the union (Local 86), and his employer in the appeals stage, trying to get compensation since he can never work again in his life after being denied because they are now saying vaccination was not mandatory. This case is so drawn out and could have been avoided had we not treated COVID-19 like we did. From all the murders due to bogus protocols in the hospitals to situations like I just described.

Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

Furthermore, the recent restrictions placed on COVID vaccinations by RFK Jr. are a SERIOUS concern. Every American must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and these vaccines need to be made widely available AS THEY HAVE BEEN (until RFK Jr. took over) and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, LONG COVID, and death for people of ALL ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. There is no scientific basis for these restrictions -in fact these restrictions IGNORE excellent research that prove that the vaccines are safe and effective for us. Please take action to reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of ALL ages, at least once a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations (mRNA and protein-based).">I am a mother of four and a COVID Long Hauler.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.
I also want to recommend to abolish all childhood vaccinations. Children without those prove to be much healthier than vaccinated children: they develop their own immune system by going through the childhood diseases and developing own antibodies. The toxins that each vaccinations entail are a great risk for children!">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I am immunocompromised. I rely on vaccination against preventable diseases to ensure my health and productivity. Without these vaccines, I am at risk of severe disease, resulting in expensive treatments (a drain on the healthcare system) and lost productivity. Without universal vaccine access, we will see more Americans calling out sick from work, burdening the medical system, and potentially becoming disabled.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I am writing to express concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These experts have an important role as independent scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee. Crucially, they provide their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are very low, and many communities in the US are affected by vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have access to updated, widely available COVID vaccines with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable; it is a waste of resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID vacci...

The numbers actually do lie because many people who are now suffering have not been reported as a vaccine injured person. I personally know 6 people suffering from horrible cancers or lifetime injuries, and they know in their hearts and minds it is a direct result of the vaccine. Yet, they were never reported as such. I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my heartfelt concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. We are still not sure the long-term and far reaching consequences just yet. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. My eldest child is entering public school, and this has me deeply worried. A close friend has been advised by her pediatrician to keep her infant son inside at all costs, given the recent outbreaks of measles (infants who are too young to be vaccinated rely on herd immunity, trusting others are vaccinating). We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I&#039;m writing to express serious concerns about the firing of all 17 CDC ACIP committee members on June 9 by RFK Jr. These experts play a crucial role in evaluating vaccine safety and efficacy, and their guidance is vital for insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program. With low vaccination rates, many communities are facing outbreaks of diseases like measles, pertussis, and COVID, which can have severe health consequences. Kids in 2025 shouldn&#039;t suffer from preventable diseases due to lack of access to vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have set policies that limit access to COVID vaccines, which is harmful to public health. Everyone needs regular access to updated COVID vaccines, fully covered by insurance. The evidence is clear: COVID vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and death. These new policies create confusion and barriers, especially for children, pregnant people, and adults under 65. We urge you to follow the evidence and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for all ages, twice a year.
Vaccine policy changes must be based on science and transparency. At the FDA, undue influence from leadership, including Vinay Prasad, has affected vaccine recommendations. This happened with the Influenza vaccine strain selection, done behind closed door... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I am writing to express my serious concerns regarding the reported dismissal of all 17 members of the ACIP, as announced by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on June 9. I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

The ACIP serves a critical role in ensuring that immunization policy in the United States is grounded in rigorous, independent scientific and clinical expertise. The committee’s recommendations directly influence vaccine availability, insurance coverage determinations, and access programs such as Vaccines for Children. It is imperative that these policies remain rooted in objective science and developed through transparent, inclusive processes.

Vaccination rates across the country remain unacceptably low for many vaccine-preventable diseases. As a result, we are witnessing resurgences of conditions such as measles, pertussis, and COVID-19—diseases that carry the risk of severe morbidity and mortality, particularly for children and vulnerable populations. No child should suffer or die due to barriers in accessing life-saving vaccines. Now more than ever, robust public health infrastructure and strong vaccination initiatives are essential.

Of particular concern are the recent policy changes that restrict access to updated COVID-19 vaccines. The evidence is unequivocal: COVID-19 vaccination within the past year significantly reduces the risk of symptomatic infection, severe disease, long-term compl...

I am writing because I am deeply concerned about the recent termination of the 17 sitting CDC ACIP (vaccine advisory panel) members.  As the guidelines for making public comment suggest, I am aware of &quot;flawed, inaccurate, or out of date information&quot; being used to make recommendations by the HHS Department. 

The vaccine advisory board members who were recently terminated were carefully chosen for their expertise in medical science. These members were also carefully screened for conflicts of interest or political bias. One of the most important roles of an advisory board member is to critique the research presented from the scientific bodies making recommendations for public policy and advice. This process requires higher education, experience in medical research, and experience in clinical practice.  Unfortunately, individuals who are highly intelligent and well-meaning, but without experience as researchers, often do not have the ability to carefully weigh and critique medical scientific literature. In other words, they don&#039;t know what they don&#039;t know. Because of this, they are very vulnerable to believing information that is shared by individuals or groups who have an agenda not backed by strong science. This makes it very likely th...

Since the moment I lost her, I’ve been in a relentless fight for answers—with nothing but resistance. I’ve contacted medical examiners. I’ve begged attorneys across New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and even outside the country. I’ve spent every night researching, crying, replaying every moment—trying to understand how my baby died and why no one will speak the truth.

And still, I have no answers.

What this has done to my family cannot be described. The trauma, the grief, the silence—it has shattered us. Losing a child is a pain that leaves you gasping for air, yet somehow the world expects you to go on. You still have to show up, take care of your other children, work, survive—while your soul is broken and you’re forced to fight systems that treat your child like a number.

We are expected to grieve quietly, meet court deadlines, and jump through hoops in a vaccine court that protects corporations—not families. We’re given a timeline to file as if grief has a schedule. As if you can think clearly after your child dies. It’s torture. There is no other word for it.

Not one person in 2025 should die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Creating barriers that limit access to COVID and other vaccines is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines, which have been shown by science to be safe and effective. The new policies also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID and other vaccines.

This is not only alarming—it is dangerous.

Vaccines are one of the most rigorously studied and effective public health tools in history. The individuals tasked with advising the CDC on immunization policy should be trained experts in fields like immunology, epidemiology, virology, and public health—not people who deny the basic science behind vaccines.

When public health policy begins to prioritize ideology over evidence, real lives are lost and others are irreversibly changed. I am one of them.

For a long time, I followed the guidance. I stayed up to date on vaccines, wore a mask, and remained healthy. But when public messaging shifted—when leaders began to downplay Covid and suggest the threat had passed—I, like many others, was misled into a false sense of safety. I let my guard down. I stopped masking. I didn’t receive the most recent booster. And then I was infected.

That infection led to Long Covid. I am now on disability. I experience post-exertional malaise that leaves me bedridden after even minimal activity. I use a wheelchair for mobility.

Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidenc... [truncated]">    Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVI... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Position Statement from the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) to the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  
Re: In Support of Maintaining a Universal COVID -19 Vaccine Policy for All Individuals 
Aged 6 Months and Older  
As a leading voice in the advancement of health equity and the representation of Hispanic nurses nationwide, the National Association of Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) strongly supports 
the continued recommendation of a universal COVID -19 vaccine policy for all in dividuals 
aged 6 months and older. We urge the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
(ACIP) to maintain and reinforce this universal policy as a cornerstone of primary 
prevention and public health equity. 
Rationale and Evidence-Based Support  
Over the past three years, racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have 
experienced signiﬁcantly higher rates of COVID -19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality 
than their white counterparts. Early in the pandemic, Black, Latino, Asian, and N ative 
American individuals faced disproportionately high rates of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. For example, the COVID -19 hospitalization rate among Latino 
individuals was four times greater than that of white patients. Alarming ly, as of August 
2021, Latinos had a COVID -19 mortality rate 9.2 times that of white patients.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access ... [truncated]">To the CDC ACIP committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

I also implore this committee to remove any mRNA shots from the childhood schedule, as well as find a way to remove mandatory immunizations for children to attend school. Children should not be forced to inject biological products into their bodies that would be considered poisonous or toxic to take by mouth.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a wa...

Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Vaccines are an incredibly important tool for public health. We have the ability to spare ourselves so much suffering through the use of vaccines. My parents and grandparents both suffered from illnesses in their childhoods that I was vaccinated against. Vaccines kept me and my community safe. Any infection has the potential for lifelong consequences. I am so grateful for the vaccines that keep me safe from the worst of these cons...

I am submitting this comment to express my strong concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The former committee members had an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, which is leading to grave risks for the most vulnerable in our communities across the US, including my friends&#039; young children and my relatives that are directly impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. These preventable infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID and other safe, established, effective vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

I am extremely concerned about the recent policies that will limit access to COVID vaccinations, and make it harder and more expensive for people to protect themselves. These policies are har... [truncated]">Dear members of the committee,

My family has been personally impacted (it has disabled a family member and injured another) by COVID-19 and doctors advise that being current on vaccines in both fall and spring is important to reduce risk of reinfection. Many people are also not able to tolerate the mRNA vaccines due to severe side effects, so the only vaccine available to those individuals is the Novavax. It&#039;s looking like the damage to many bodies is permanent and repeat infections risk even greater damage as many studies have shown.

It&#039;s critical for all people to have access to COVID-19 vaccines. Whether they choose to take them or not depends on their particular situation, but the government needs to ensure they are available to people who want and need them, without any restrictions or limitations, and not hinder or delay access.

Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of severe symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To: RFK Jr. and Member of the CDC ACIP Committee: 

I am a 68-year-old resident and have benefitted from free, accessible choice to use the COVID vaccine during and after the pandemic.  As a health care provider, this vaccine allowed me to stay safe, continue to work, and keep me and my patients – seniors, pregnant, adult, and youth -- from transferring infections.  By staying safe, with the support of these vaccines, I was able to limit the spread of infection in my household to my partner, who is retired and susceptible to lung illness, and to my community.  Others’ choice to do the same kept the community’s public health at high standard.

I urge you to continue the policy of access to free and accessible vaccines, including COVID vaccine.

I am deeply alarmed at the termination of all members of the CDC ACIP committee and at the rejection of science and evidence that this infers.  I urge you reinstate the members of this committee and preserve an independent decision process with expert advisors.  

I urge you to:  
	maintain the policy of universal access to all vaccines
	maintain the recommendations of past CDC advisors for the public to continue to get vaccines for the best good of individual and public health (twice a year for COVID vaccines) 
	continue to act in accord with science and evidence, with transparency and public input.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. We ask you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Dear RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee,

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Please also look into the history of declining incidence of all the diseases that vaccines were said to eradicate and see how they were on a steep decline before vaccinations were introduced.  Then consider that the toxic cocktail that goes into all vaccines are inherently harmful to the human body.  How can you mandate a vaccine for children to go to school that you know may permanently harm them?  Please urge congress to repeal the 1986 vaccine immunity for vaccine makers.  This will regain the trust of nearly all Americans in our governmental health institutions.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

I’m writing as a mother of young children, a patient who relies on access to safe and effective care, and an American who values science-based public health policy.

I was deeply alarmed to learn that all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were recently dismissed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This unprecedented move undermines public confidence in the independence and integrity of vaccine recommendations—recommendations that protect families like mine from preventable illness and death.  Replacing the 17 members with 8 well known vaccine skeptics only serves to further undermine Americans&#039; trust in RFK Jr.&#039;s ability to spearhead HHS in the best interest of all citizens.  

As someone who has navigated immunosuppressive treatment and complex health decisions, I know firsthand how vital it is to have access to clear, consistent, and evidence-based vaccine guidance. I am especially concerned that RFK Jr.’s decision threatens the transparency and scientific rigor the public depends on—particularly at a time when trust in health institutions is already fragile.

I want to express my strong support for the CDC’s mission and for universal access to safe, effective vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines for people of all ages. I urge you to continue defending policies based on sound science and public health needs—not politics or ideology.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

For decades now, we have understood the efficacy of vaccines and observed their benefits firsthand. FDA-approved vaccines of all kinds are safe and effective for babies, kids, adults, and the elderly. Vaccines developed to target strains of COVID-19 have been shown to reduce COVID-19 transmission, severity, and instances of Long Covid. Though acute and Long Covid are real, the solutions to combat them are just as real. Vaccines work. I urge you to recommend FDA-approved vaccines universally, especially those for COVID-19 prevention, twice a year.

The evidence couldn&#039;t be any stronger: FDA-approved vaccines work. ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US. ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually. ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

In addition, I demand that RFK Jr. preserves an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP. I demand that he reverses the decision to remove the recent expert adviso... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Please restore the fired members of the ACIP committee so they are at least equal in number to the new members and reschedule the June 25-26 meeting. You have stacked the committee with unqualified, political zealots who are well-known opponents to any vaccine. Any evidence these people present and any vote they make is likely to be predetermined by their prior beliefs of conspiracy theories about vaccines. Instead of restoring consumers’ trust in the government’s vaccine decisions, you are destroying it. 

*Please remove any discussion of thimerosal and MMRV (measles) vaccines for children. These have been proven safe many, many times. Without legitimate scientists and doctors on the ACIP committee, any discussion of these will be considered worthless or propaganda.

Informed people will reject what comes out of the current ACIP committee, but a much larger group of people will be frightened away from ANY vaccine. Most Americans don&#039;t have the luxury of consulting informed sources about vaccine safety. They get health news from social media, quack Websites, &quot;influencers,&quot; and their crazy MAGA uncles. Once you scare a young mother, it&#039;s very hard to unscare her. My family has many children and grandchildren in Texas, Georgia, and New York, including 5 children under age 5 and a 6-week old infant, so accurate information about vaccines is very important to me for the safety of my family!

Public Comment to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)Date: June 19, 2025Submitted by: Adrianna WilliamsIntroductionI am Adrianna Williams, a concerned citizen who has spent ample time researching the risks of vaccines and advocating for the abolishment of unethical medical interventions. My interest in this issue stems from hearing personal experiences with vaccine-related adverse events in families and work and communities questioning the safety of immunization programs. I have closely followed discussions on platforms like X, such as STOP THE SHOTS community where studies and information on resources are shared highlighting vaccine dangers (@AdriannaWi36073), and I draw from resources like learntherisk.org, which compiles evidence of vaccine harm. As a concerned citizen, I submit this comment to urge the ACIP to halt its 2024–2025 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recommendations and abolish all vaccines due to their unacceptable risks to public health.BackgroundThis comment addresses the ACIP’s recommendations for the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine schedule, as outlined in the Federal Register notice for the June 2025 meeting, and extends to the broader ACIP process for endorsing vaccines on childhood and adult immunization schedules. I speciﬁcally challenge the continued promotion of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., Pﬁzer’s Comirnaty and Moderna’s Spikevax) and routine vaccines like MMR, DTaP, and polio. My position is tha...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I am a PhD student in public health and I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have played critical roles as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee, including offering key information based on their deep knowledge &amp; expertise regarding the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Eve... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Moreover, the callous disregard for respected experts who have dedicated their lives to medicine and public health, and the usurping of long established protocols is very difficult to watch.  Announcing a major decision about covid-19 vaccines in a video on Twitter/X and publishing an article in the Wall Street Journal announcing that the ACIP members were being fired is a totally inappropriate way for someone in his position to act.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market.

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

As a U.S. citizen who cares deeply about my health and public health across the United States, I strongly condemn the efforts that HHS Secretary Kennedy is undertaking to undermine the integrity of medicine and public health in the United States. Any properly trained medical professional can attest to the thoroughness of vaccination studies and the safety of vaccines available to the public. Secretary Kennedy has, in flagrant and reckless defiance of medical consensus, not to mention in blatant contravention to his supposed promises to Senator Cassidy during his confirmation process, used his position to cast aspersions on the medical profession and inflame unfounded fears of vaccination. Make no mistake: rescinding any regulations or guidance that recommend already-safe and effective vaccines, particularly for diseases like COVID-19, HPV, and measles, will result in the deaths of the most vulnerable Americans, including the children and pregnant people whom the Secretary claims to want to protect. Even merely to contemplate issuing such an unwise rescission while claiming to &quot;Make America Healthy Again&quot; shocks the conscience in its callousness, dishonesty, and cruelty.

If the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) truly cares about best practices for immunizations, then it must remain independent and stocked with experts, not anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists. Secretary Kennedy must reverse his unwise dismissal of ACIP members, dismiss tho... [truncated]">Dear Ms. Thomas:

This is not restoring trust. This is a purge, and it will be deadly.

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was one of the most respected scientific bodies in public health, now it’s gone. And RFK Jr. replaced them with ideological loyalists. Scientists who had spent decades studying disease, understanding vaccine efficacy, and preparing for public health crises were erased overnight, all because RFK Jr. doesn&#039;t trust science.

Last week, he ended HIV vaccine research on the eve of clinical trials. The week before that he canceled over $700 million in funding for a promising Bird Flu vaccine just as H5N1 started spreading among cattle and humans. Both actions spit in the face of every lesson learned from COVID-19.

This is the biggest rollback of vaccine infrastructure since the start of the 21st century, and it’s already making us less safe.

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

1) Everyone should have access to updated Covid vaccines yearly - do not remove access for children, healthy adults, and pregnant people -- anyone can get Long Covid and the impacts of it are devastating

 2) the recently modified process for vaccine approvals should be re-instated and everyone on the original ACIP should be re-instated

 3) we should be following the science, not following reports that hallucinate studies that don&#039;t exist or cite inaccurate conclusions from ones that do exist, constituting disinformation.

I will follow up on many of these points below with further thoughts based in science and based in my experience as a human being and parent.

RE 1)  Science: The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of  money and time to do more studies. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. We don&#039;t need to redo these studies every time we match it to a strain and we don&#039;t need to remove access from any population. If some people don&#039;t want to get vaccines, that&#039;s on them and that&#039;s their choice, but don&#039;t remove them from those of us who do.

RE 1) Human being: I am so desperate to protect my child and my family from the harms of acute and long covid and balance that with living a life that is not cut off from reality. A life where we get to see friends, go to weddings, co... [truncated]">I am writing about three interrelated issues:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I write to you as a concerned public health educator who has shared information about vaccines to community members and done cancer research. I have always offered all of the information and encouraged conversations to illuminate what barriers stand in the way of preventing infectious diseases. We have countless data to back up how quality of life has improved since the implementation of vaccines. Please understand I do not say any of this lightly; I have always wished to lessen morbidity and mortality, which will be the unfortunate end result if this decision is not reversed. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, a...

Introduction
 
On
 
behalf
 
of
 
Men’ s
 
Health
 
Network
 
(MHN),
 
a
 
national
 
nonprofit
 
dedicated
 
to
 
improving
 
the
 
health
 
and
 
well-being
 
of
 
men
 
and
 
boys,
 
we
 
urge
 
the
 
Advisory
 
Committee
 
on
 
Immunization
 
Practices
 
(ACIP)
 
to
 
strengthen
 
HPV
 
vaccine
 
recommendations
 
and
 
expand
 
outreach
 
targeting
 
young
 
males.
 
MHN
 
prioritizes
 
preventive
 
care,
 
particularly
 
where
 
disparities
 
in
 
vaccination
 
and
 
health
 
education
 
persist.
 
 
Backgr ound
 
ACIP
 
recommends
 
routine
 
HPV
 
vaccination
 
beginning
 
at
 
age
 
11
 
or
 
12,
 
with
 
catch-up
 
vaccination
 
through
 
age
 
26
 
for
 
all
 
individuals
 
(Meites
 
et
 
al.,
 
2019).
 
However ,
 
vaccine
 
uptake
 
differs
 
significantly
 
by
 
sex.
 
In
 
2023,
 
64.0%
 
of
 
adolescent
 
females
 
were

compared
 
to
 
only
 
59.0%
 
of
 
adolescent
 
males
 
(Pingali
 
et

2024).
 
This
 
gap
 
reflects
 
the
 
misconception
 
that

is
 
primarily
 
a

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidenc... [truncated]">    Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Plus, the two times I have had COVID I have had a very hard time bouncing back, despite being vaccinated. I can only imagine how much harder it would have been if I had been infected prior to vaccines being available. Because of these reasons I expect RFK Junior to comply with the testimony he gave the US Senate at his confirmation hearings - that he will preserve an independent decision process with the CDC&#039;s ACIP and support scientifically back vaccines. This follows that he will reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisers. Furthermore I expect ACIP will disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest and continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US - including a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines at least twice annually.

If vaccines are restricted or eliminated, my life will be especially at risk as a disabled, chronically ill, immunocompromised person, as well as those of my family and friends who are also disabled and/or chronically ill and/or immunocompromised. We need as many people as possible to be vaccinated. Everyone needs that. Everyone deserves to be protected from preventable diseases. Right now, vaccinated rates for many diseases are already too low and so our communities are being impacted by outbreaks of preventable diseases, like measles or pertussis.

I support the scientific consensus that routine vaccination, with safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines, saves the lives of everyone of all ages. Vaccines improve our quality of life and our lifespans. They reduce disability, infections, and death. Access to vaccines is, and should remain, an essential part of public health and disease prevention. Everyone deserves the freedom and right to have access to safe and effective vaccines.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. As a disabled person who is at a high-risk for poor health outcomes as a result of Covid, I understand how important access to these vaccinations are. 

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. 
I am writing to express my strong advocacy for CDC ACIP expert advisors. Those advisors must support widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of safe and effective vaccines, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.
Furthermore, we must use science and scientific evidence to guide recommendations. Currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective. Children, adults, and pregnant people all rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
Finally, We need a universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually. My father suffered from polio as a child, before the vaccine was available. My uncle died of COVID, before a vaccine was available. I am a historian of childhood and education and I know the evidence of the suffering and high mortality rates of children before the breakthrough of vaccines. We do not want to repeat this painful and preventable episode from our past. As a nation, we must protect those who cannot get vaccines because of age or disability or illness by encouraging science-backed vaccines among the rest of us.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

In my own experience, vaccines have caused me the same severity in side effects as all other vaccines protecting my health. They have allowed my only COVID infection to be relatively mild compared to what it could have been. All people should have access to... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment on ACIP Nominations

 I rely on science-based medicine and vaccine guidance to stay alive and well. I’ve watched with deep concern as disinformation has spread in recent years, threatening not just public health, but the very trust that allows communities to care for one another. That’s why I strongly oppose the nomination of Vicky Pebsworth, Martin Kulldorff, Retsef Levi, and Robert Malone to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

These individuals have publicly undermined the scientific consensus on vaccines, promoted conspiracy theories, and in some cases, admitted to lacking direct vaccine expertise—despite that being a clear requirement for ACIP service. For example:
    •    Retsef Levi has acknowledged his limited experience with vaccines, yet has made unsupported claims that mRNA vaccines cause death.
    •    Martin Kulldorff refused COVID-19 vaccination while in a public teaching role and promoted strategies that contradicted ethical public health principles during a deadly pandemic.
    •    Robert Malone has spread misleading claims suggesting that mRNA vaccines worsen infection outcomes.
    •    Vicky Pebsworth serves on the board of an organization known for spre...

Dear Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),
I am submitting this comment for the June 25–27, 2025, ACIP meeting to urge the CDC to prioritize personal choice, vaccine safety, unrestricted access, and equity in your recommendations for the 2025-2026 COVID-19 and influenza vaccine schedules. Having received seven COVID-19 vaccines (four Pfizer, two Moderna, and one Novavax) I can personally attest to their safety and effectiveness. I experienced no adverse side effects, and my experience is supported by robust scientific evidence demonstrating these vaccines’ critical role in reducing severe outcomes and Long COVID during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
I strongly believe in my right to choose whether, when, and which COVID-19 and influenza vaccines to receive, including the option to pay out-of-pocket for additional doses if insurance does not cover them. There should be no restrictions on who can access these vaccines. Thus any adult who wants a vaccine should have the right to get one. Data confirms these vaccines are safe and effective, with some individuals benefiting from more frequent dosing based on personal health needs [1-2]. If individuals are concerned about the safety of these vaccines, they can simply opt not to get them. However, those who choose not to vaccinate should not f...

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

 We live in a multigenerational household. RFK Jr. wants to limit vaccine access to all but my husband and I, which not only endangers my children and grandchildren, but further endangers us.

Vaccines are safe and effective for children, adults, and pregnant women, and no member of ACIP should oppose vaccinations for any of those groups. Everyone deserves access to these life-saving treatments.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

I believe the COVID shots are bioweapons that were unleashed on the human population. The makers knew they were dangerous and would cause much damage, including death, to people of all ages. They were also aware that these shots were weakening the immune system and people would develop autoimmune issues, heart issues. Likely shortening the lifespan for those who succumbed to taking the shots. This was an intentional act. And it was a horrendous act. Everyone one of those shots should be taken off the market and destroyed. The makers should not make one more dime on this product.

I therefore urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market.
