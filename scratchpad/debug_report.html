I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 

The ACIP committee has a crucial role in assessing the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Their recommendations also guide decisions made by insurance companies about insurance coverage. 

Vaccines play a vital role in preventing serious diseases. While the focus is often on children, I have spent 25 years working with cancer patients and must draw attention to how critical it is to prevent illness in those undergoing cancer treatment and in cancer survivors. As just one example, those who receive bone marrow transplants often lose all previous immunity to illness. They need to have the option to be safely vaccinated in order to regain immunity to life-threatening illnesses. 

In saying this, I don’t want to minimize the importance in other people. Vaccine-preventable diseases can cause death and lifelong health problems in all groups of people, including children. Everyone should have access to effective vaccines that are covered by insurance. 
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have already limited access to recently established COVID vaccinations. Their restrictions do not align with scientific evidence which has established... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express my concern about the firing of all members of the CDC ACIP committee, and their replacement by hand-picked members just before this important committee meeting.
Vaccines have been proven to save lives. Policies that limit access to vaccines, specifically to Covid vaccines, will cause unnecessary illness, suffering, long Covid, and deaths. Scientific evidence-based recommendations for vaccine use should not be thrown out the window for political reasons or the personal beliefs of those in charge.
The United States should be providing scientifically-based health care to all, and vaccines are an important part of protecting all of us in this day and age, when the recent pandemic uprooted all of our lives.
Our government should be of the people and FOR the people. Taking away the important protections that vaccines provide will put ALL of us at greater risk. 
I ask you to reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year. As a committee, you must take action to ensure that all vaccine policy decisions are made based on scientific evidence, in an open and transparent process.">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

First let us recognize that you are in place illegitimately.  Sec. Kennedy fired all the prior ACIP members and installed the current members without oversight and without regard to background checks or checks of any sort, just on his say-so that you&#039;re &quot;okay&quot;. Sec. Kennedy also lied to Senator Cassidy about doing such an act -- specifically that he would not do something to undermine vaccines and firing ACIP members is exactly that.  So, someone else will figure out if it rises to the level of perjury (I think it does) but it is obviously a violation of his promise.

Second, let us recognize that you come here specifically with a pre-determined agenda to do away with vaccines.  How horrible! How can you do such a thing? How does this benefit you? Money? Power? Some satisfaction in seeing the American people get sicker and more diseased and die more?  Before vaccines, people died a lot. They died of communicable diseases. They suffered a lot. Even if they didn&#039;t die, they got sick and had to get through that, sometimes they had lingering issues that never went away. This doesn&#039;t make America stronger, it makes us sick and weaker. 

Third, the various lies about how vaccines are understudied or have something in them you don&#039;t like or they cause autism. Vaccines are very well studied. Vaccines don&#039;t contain dead bits of babies. Vaccines don&#039;t cause autism. In fact, you use that sort of language to undermine vaccines and to make people afraid.  To be clear: y...

As a Tribal Member, Public Health Professional, and lifetime advocate of health and wellness, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

The former CDC ACIP members had an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The scientific evidence supports the efficacy of vaccines, and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. 

I ask you to take action based on the research and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.

Not only do I need vaccines, but so do people who come in contact with me so they do not spread illness to me. Under current proposed rules, my family and close friends will not be able to get vaccines approved for them since they are too young and not unhealthy. This puts me at great risk and my becoming ill not only adds to the emotional and financial cost of my family, but helps to spread illness in my community. None of this is helpful and can be extremely costly and harmful. Therefore, I urge you to approve vaccines for all persons – or at very least those who are household residents of those who would be otherwise approved for vaccines.

In addition, the recent changes in ACIP membership can be a great blow to me and people like me. Removing the committee without demonstrating clearly what was done wrong does not provide more trust in this system but can destroy such trust in decisions of public health officials.

Further, and very importantly, we need ACIP and its wise counsel to obtain insurance coverage of vaccines. Removing ACIP may make people uncertain of the vaccines that are covered, leading them to not obtain these vaccines. Plus, if not covered by insurance, there is bound to be underutilization of vaccines, causing all of us harm and espe...

During that time I witnessed many instances when staff and managers wanted to advocate for decisions that &quot;felt right&quot;; I was one of many scientists that insisted on the primacy of the data, which sometimes was contrary to perceived experience and intuition. The importance of scientiﬁc data was helped by the requirement that all of the experts with input needed to document their reasoning for the archived record. Those experts were both internal and advisory. I appreciated being able to trust and learn from the input of experts in different disciplines who worked on the same regulatory decisions as I did. I also appreciated being able to trust the decisions of my fellow federal employees for products that I was not involved with. Now that I&#039;m retired, I rely entirely on their expertise. My trust in those decisions has been shaken in the past several months because of mass federal ﬁrings, intimidation, overruling of scientists by the political appointees, and now, radical changes to the tried and tested advisory committee system [1-3].I have not always agreed with the decisions made by fed...

During that time I witnessed many instances when staff and managers wanted to advocate for decisions that &quot;felt right&quot;; I was one of many scientists that insisted on the primacy of the data, which sometimes was contrary to perceived experience and intuition. The importance of scientiﬁc data was helped by the requirement that all of the experts with input needed to document their reasoning for the archived record. Those experts were both internal and advisory. I appreciated being able to trust and learn from the input of experts in different disciplines who worked on the same regulatory decisions as I did. I also appreciated being able to trust the decisions of my fellow federal employees for products that I was not involved with. Now that I&#039;m retired, I rely entirely on their expertise.

My name is Ardina and I am a nurse at Harboview Medical Center in Seattle WA. I am also 30 weeks pregnant. I just got a COVID booster to pass down antibodies to the baby in my womb. I am so grateful that the vaccine is still available. My husband is also planning to get the COVID booster to protect our newborn in the first few months when his immune system is still developing. 

Keeping COVID vaccines available is very important to me. I hope you will consider continuing to recommend yearly COVID boosters, or at least keep them available for people who would like to get them. Vaccinations work best when everyone has access to them. 

Thank you,

I’m writing as a concerned individual with no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I was deeply alarmed to hear about the termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee, as announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The independent, expert advice that this committee provides is essential for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines. This guidance not only shapes access to vaccines, but also plays a vital role in insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program, which helps protect uninsured kids.

Right now, vaccination rates for many diseases remain far too low. We&#039;re already seeing the consequences—outbreaks of preventable illnesses like measles, pertussis, and COVID-19. These are not minor issues—these infections can have serious, even lifelong effects, especially for children and others who aren’t vaccinated. No child should suffer—or worse, die—because they couldn’t access an affordable vaccine. We need strong, clear support for vaccine campaigns that reach everyone.

I&#039;m especially concerned about the recent restrictions on COVID-19 vaccines. Everyone should have regular, reliable access to updated COVID vaccines. They need to be widely available and fully covered by insurance. The science is crystal clear: getting a COVID vaccine within the past year significantly lowers the risk of symptoms, severe illness, long-term complications, and death—even for people who were previously healthy....

I am very concerned by the direction this country is going scientifically in general but especially in regards to vaccines. RF Kennedy Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.

It is also very concerning that decisions appear to be getting made before meeting with anyone with knowledge about the topics in question. This is disturbing since RFK Jr is not a public health expert in any way. 
Please ensure all members of ACIP disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US. Our country’s health and workforce relies on these being available. 

ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually. This is a cost-saving measure as covid continues to disable and cost the business sectors billions per year. 

Please put the health of the people first and make sure those are considered and put into action. Thank you, a concerned citizen.">Hello-

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I am a public and population health nurse, having worked on the front lines for over 40 years and believe I have an ethical obligation to speak out about the most recent announcement about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low. I know this not only from my experience having worked alongside populations who suffered extreme illness and disabilities because of misinformation and disinformation that prevented them from vaccinating their children. Do you know what it is like to watch a 5 week old newborn cough and cough because they were exposed to whooping cough from unvaccinated people around them, which requires not only an expensive pediatric intensive care stay in the hospital, but weeks thereafter in the home setting (if they survive)!  Our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Child... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

We need to have access to COVID vaccines twice a year for everyone, as per scientific evidence. I urge the committee to reverse it&#039;s steps and to follow the science.

I am also writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID.

Access doesn&#039;t mean people are required to get vaccinated. It only means that people who want or need to can do so, and without undue hardship. Infection can permanently disable or kill people, as it has already disabled and killed millions, and repeat infections have been proven to cause cumulative damage.

My family has been personally impacted (it has disabled a family member and injured another) by COVID-19 and doctors advise that being current on vaccines in both fall and spring is important to reduce risk of reinfection. Many people are also not able to tolerate the mRNA vaccines due to severe side effects, so the only vaccine available to those individuals is the Novavax. It&#039;s looking like the damage to many bodies is permanent and repeat infections risk even greater damage as many studies have shown.

It&#039;s critical for all people to have access to COVID-19 vaccines. Whether they choose to take them or not depends on their particular situation, but the government needs to ensure they are available to people who want and need them, without any restrictions or limitations, and not hinder or delay access.

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to...

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. My wife is currently pregnant with twins and making vaccines seem &quot;dangerous&quot; is harmful to their health and makes it much harder to convince their grandparents to get vaccines to protect their health.

1. RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with

This decision is going to erode trust in vaccines, cause more people to get sick as they withhold vaccines from the public. 

People will die as a result of this. This isn’t hyperbole this is fact.   

I work in the service industry, I need to be vaccinated so I can maintain hours at work and can’t financially withstand losing work/hours due to being sick when it is entirely preventable. 

I have heard horror stories from my parents about polio and it is disgusting that it could be possible that these stories will become a horrible reality again. 

My partner is a nurse and is at risk of exposure and he is 58 years old, the risk of him getting sick are too possible, especially exposed to the public. 

Last week my uncle went to the ER for Covid. He’s luckily out now but still sick. I have friends who have had serious medical issues from long covid. One friend has MS and one friends husband took his own life because a specific form of dementia he developed from having long covid.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I am a citizen with concerns for public health and the health of my loved ones, and access to COVID vaccinations is an important part of protecting our health.
I am very concerned about the newly established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. I’m urging you to follow the evidence and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.
I urge this committee to ensure that all vaccine policy decisions are considered, evaluated, and concluded using open and transparent processes, all of which are hallmarks of democracy.
I am also very concerned about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee.  These former members have an important role as independent exp... [truncated]">To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I depend on vaccines to keep my family safe, and any disregard for established CDC procedures deeply concerns me—especially as a parent of a young child. It seems RFK Jr. has chosen political allies over public health experts, and that’s a dangerous path.


I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. These individuals are not making policies that help the public. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I am a mother of two children who, after having COVID, experienced 35 illnesses in the course of a year and a half. I am writing from this perspective, but have no other conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyon... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Countless Americans are already suffering long-term disability due to unchecked COVID spread. They will require more healthcare across their lifetimes and many are already less able to support the economy because their disabilities diminish or eliminate their ability to work. Furthermore, high-risk individuals who have access to vaccines are more likely to leave their homes to shop, recreate, go out to eat, etc. Without vaccine protection, many of these folks are forced to stay home, where they suffer lonely isolation AND they spend less money as shoppers and diners. If your discussion includes concerns about vaccine safety, published, peer-reviewed studies can be used to craft UNBIASED release forms that require a patient’s signature before vaccine administration. The forms should also describe the risks associated with NOT being vaccinated. This approach helps eliminate any argument that “people don’t know the risks”.">Please keep COVID vaccines accessible and affordable.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a wa...

In mid-June, Fionna Havers who oversaw CDC respiratory virus data, told colleagues she no longer had confidence that the data would be used objectively to set vaccine policy.

“’Unfortunately, I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,’ Havers wrote in a Monday morning email to colleagues obtained by The Washington Post. CDC staff including Havers present hospitalization data at nearly every public meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisory committee. Last week, Kennedy ousted all members of that panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — and replaced them with his own picks, including at least three people who have criticized the use of mRNA coronavirus vaccines. Two of his appointees testified against vaccine manufacturers as expert witnesses in lawsuits, and another served on the board of the nation’s oldest anti-vaccine group.”

Many people rely on CDC vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines that are covered by insurance, and changing these recommendations hurts the people who need protection the most. Americans already have some of the worst access to healthcare out of all developed countries and abandoning vaccine recommendations will make this exponentially worse for all of us.">Comment:

Social Security has been a concern for a while now. The reserve was spent down and now the social security inputs are being directly turned around as payments. Part off the reason for this is that the large &quot;boomer&quot; segment of the population has reached retirement age, another is that because of fears of not getting anything, a lot of people are filing earlier than they might have. 

While the conventional understanding is that either Social Security has to cut benefits or increase in-take, there also seems to be a mind set that maybe this current administration just wants to kill off people so that Social Security output would go down. We hear this from different officials -- &#039;get people off social security and Medicaid/Medicare and they go back to work&#039; and trying to force people onto only employer paid health insurances, making it harder for people to access government services. 

Limiting vaccine access ties into this. Fewer available vaccines means more people getting sick and potentially dying. During the early days of the Covid Pandemic many said grandparents should be willing to die for the sake of the economy. 

This is ghoulish and gruesome. People deserve to live and they deserve to live with their health. 

Limiting vaccines will only cause more people to have poor health and poor health means they might not be able to care for themselves....

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVI... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I urge new ACIP members simply to properly apply the tests that we, the informed public, all know they should when considering each vaccine and each cohort of patients. 
The vaccine must be 
Safe
Effective 
Necessary
Strong evidence is needed for each. Safety requires long term double-blind placebo-controlled trials of sufficient statistical power, where the placebo is a true, inert one.
Effectiveness must be measured against an actual outcome that is easily recognised as beneficial (prevention of infection and transmission robustly measured, not an intermediate outcome like an immune response). 
And necessary means that there is a real threat to public health in the specific patient cohort that cannot be evinced by an available treatment or by general healthy living. 

I don’t believe any vaccine can meet the criteria above. It is your job to find out.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I&#039;m writing to express serious concerns about the firing of all 17 CDC ACIP committee members on June 9 by RFK Jr. These experts play a crucial role in evaluating vaccine safety and efficacy, and their guidance is vital for insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program. With low vaccination rates, many communities are facing outbreaks of diseases like measles, pertussis, and COVID, which can have severe health consequences. Kids in 2025 shouldn&#039;t suffer from preventable diseases due to lack of access to vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have set policies that limit access to COVID vaccines, which is harmful to public health. Everyone needs regular access to updated COVID vaccines, fully covered by insurance. The evidence is clear: COVID vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease and death. These new policies create confusion and barriers, especially for children, pregnant people, and adults under 65. We urge you to follow the evidence and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for all ages, twice a year.
Vaccine policy changes must be based on science and transparency. At the FDA, undue influence from leadership, including Vinay Prasad, has affected vaccine recommendations. This happened with the Influenza vaccine strain selection, done behind closed door... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I work in Pharmacy, I have been a Liscensed Pharmacy Technician who started working for Rite Aid in 2023. I have seen the greed of drug companies, wholesalers like Mckesson and Cardinal, and the PBMs that bleed pharmacies dry penny by penny, patients overperscribed dozens of meds to appease drug reps and a frankly stunning number of Hydrocodone scripts and other opiods. And if these were the issues the administration were tackling instead I would applaud. And yet instead what we are seeing is a systematic attack on science and reason, dismantling advisory panels for vaccinations and mind boggling statements handwriting the dangers of the return of measles in this country. Wasting resources to question a link between vaccines and autism, a link that numerous studies have found no evidence of, and those that did have been discredited and proven fraudulent and or flawed.

I am appalled that the disregard for the publics health could be so flagrant. And if we continue down this path, I fear for the health outcomes of all Americans.">I am appalled at the dismantling of our safeguards and protections for the health of the American people.

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Vaccines are proven effective and denying access to them condemns people to poor health outcomes, and sometimes death.   

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular a... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

It is reflective of a marketing campaign by vaccine producers and in no way reflects the actual efficacy or safety. The Safety Data Sheets for Covid Vaccines were blank.

What is the legitimate justification for a recommendation of a covid vaccine if you know that no testing has taken place and there is no liability from producers?  There is no emergency use at this time. 

You must follow basic common sense and provide for safety first,  instead of  letting injury after the fact indicate our lack of critical analysis. There are enough vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the US to enable these studies.

I am very concerned upon hearing that all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee have been fired from their positions. Their expertise on vaccines is really important, and they helped people get insurance coverage for vaccines.
As measles cases increase, and because COVID is still being spread, access to safe vaccines is critically important. People, especially children, need to have affordable access to vaccines.
Limiting access to vaccines, including the COVID vaccines, has recently become a favored policy objective of RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad. This puts people in danger of severe illness, disability, and death. There is abundant scientific evidence that the COVID vaccines are safe and effective, and save lives.
Removing COVID vaccine access from children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65 is a very dangerous idea. If more people are unvaccinated, then they can spread COVID to vulnerable people very quickly, including to adults over 65. Limiting vaccine access is a blatant misunderstanding of how vaccines are supposed to work. If more people are vaccinated, then disease spreads less.
I ask that you reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.
Any changes to vaccine-related policies requires a science and evidence-based approach entailing an open, and transparent process. Similarly at... [truncated]">To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am filling out a comment to express my concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. No one should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines, and it so it is critical to have access to preventative healthcare.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

My daughter ended up in the hospital after getting the flu when she was 5 months old. She was too young to get a flu vaccine. No mother should have to see their child suffer with illness if it can be prevented.">We need clear guidance on COVID-19 vaccines. We need them to be available to pregnant women especially.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

To best serve the public interest, it is imperative that the decisions made regarding vaccines be based on the best scientific data, that they are made by experts, that there is no conflict of interest or pressure to make a certain decision, that the process is transparent and allows ample opportunities for public comment. I am deeply disturbed that this is not what has happened. The recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee will greatly hinder the ability to make the best decisions. They have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program and as such, need to be reinstated. 

. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. 

Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express my concern about vaccine access. It is vital that the ACIP preserve the universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for all people at least twice annually. Any barriers to accessing these and other vital vaccines are harmful to the public&#039;s health. Everyone must have access to affordable vaccines. As someone who works with the public, I have seen time and time again how my vaccines have prevented me from getting seriously ill, and I know that getting vaccinated helps protect not just myself, but those around me as well. I beg this committee to ensure that all vaccine policy decisions are considered, evaluated, and concluded using open and transparent processes--these are key components of democracy. Thank you for your time!">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. Covid vaccines should also be offered to healthy individuals and children so they can remain healthy and not contract disease that will surely cause them to be unhealthy due to lack of protection. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Diseases like measles, whooping cough, mumps, and others had largely been eradicated without harm to those receiving the vaccines. Now we have a leader of the CDC who is not a scientist, not a physician, a man with warped and distorted views about nonexistent harmful effects to these lifesaving vaccines.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

In my years of internal medicine training in Detroit and in medical school in Ohio, I have seen patients die of vaccine preventable disease like streptococcus pneumoniae (causing meningitis or inflammation of lining of brain or pneumonia)) and COVID-19 (even patients with COVID associated end stage renal disease AKA COVAN) and influenza. I&#039;ve seen patients struggle mightily with the painful lesions of shingles and the lingering, debilitating pain after. I&#039;ve seen healthy people critically ill from COVID and flu.

I&#039;ve counseled hundreds of patients on vaccines, answered questions, and asked them to reach out if they have concerns.
After reading and discussing the facts, patients often choose to be protected, but sometimes they don&#039;t.

Experts must be allowed to make apolitical decisions about recommendations, so physicians can counsel patients on all recommended vaccines and insurers will pay for them. I see far too many patients in the hospital on the brink of death because of our failure as a system to invest in critical preventive technologies like vaccines. We need to prevent threats like measles from taking hold and leading to even more chronic disease we struggle to catch up.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP ... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Comments to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) June 25-26, 2025 The Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease (PFID) is deeply concerned that the wholesale removal of all 17 voting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has injected unnecessary instability into the nation’s immunization infrastructure and risks sowing greater confusion among the public and increasing vaccine hesitancy. For over 60 years, ACIP has been the global standard for reviewing evidence and making recommendations to prevent millions of hospitalizations and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, polio, and inﬂuenza. The committee&#039;s recommendation process has been an example for global health bodies. The U.S. approach – guided by evidence and rooted in independent expertise, not ideology – has long been a model of transparency, rigor, and public accountability. Disregarding long-standing norms by ﬁring an entire advisory committee without due cause sends a chilling message to scientists, clinicians, public health professionals, and the country at large: Expertise, experience, and evidence matter less than ideological alignment.  Experience is not a conﬂict of interest.

Docket: CDC -2025 -0024  
Public Comment for the June 25 -27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting  
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:  
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.  
I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members 
of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  
Why did he do this?  
These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or 
clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding 
of the safety and efficacy of FDA -approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding 
insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for 
Children program.  
Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many 
communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine -preventable 
diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause 
serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children should not die 
or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable 
and effective vaccines.  
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit 
access to COVID vaccinations.   
Why did they do this?  
Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular 
access to updated COVID vaccines... [truncated]">See attached file(s)

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines an... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

1. I am concerned that financial conflicts of interest could negatively affect decision making in ACIP. How are conflicts of interest being evaluated? Will they be evaluated by a qualified independent organization? They should be released as soon as possible. 
2. As a taxpayer and a believer in a strong public health agency, I expect that ACIP members will have appropriate expertise in fields such as Virology, Immunology, Epidemiology, and Infectious Disease. The detailed qualifications of members need to be made accessible to the public at large as soon as possible.
3. As a concerned elderly person with a family member whose life has changed significantly due to prolonged long covid, I need to understand why the committees under the HHS have failed to select a variant for the fall SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Please explain how this is defensible. It has been shown that without an updated booster shot, development of debilitating long COVID is more likely.

Thank you for this chance to comment.">I am a concerned citizen who relies on high-quality research and recommendations in the public health field. We need to make public health decisions based on the best scientific understanding we can muster. ACIP is critical to good public health policy.

By the year 2000, no one died and no one was hospitalized with severe measles. The main reason we are now seeing some measles outbreaks is that some children are not being immunized.

And I wish you the best of luck deciding fate.">Being able to access COVID-19 vaccines can be life or death, and even when it's not, not being allowed to get one can lead to permanent disability. If you choose to restrict access to COVID-19 vaccines, you may leave the US without a workforce left with which to continue the economy of the nation. D...</td>

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of ALL vaccines prior to marketing.  

In addition, I implore you, with regard to current mandated vaccines for infants and children, that these vaccines should all be a CHOICE for parents, not a mandate. Too many children are being injured (and/or dying) from some of these mandated vaccines. Some pediatricians are pushing for 6-7 shots in ONE  visit, which is just ludicrous. This must stop - we cannot keep poisoning our children and grandchildren like this, especially without proper testing of these vaccines.  I urge you to take immediate action on this issue.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.

I am a mother of an infant, physician, and also hold a masters degree in public health. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is...

As an immunocompromised and chronically ill person, I do whatever I can to avoid becoming sick. For 5 years, I have successfully avoided ANY Covid-19 infections by getting vaccinated 2x a year and effectively masking in crowds. No acute infections, and no disabling Long Covid. Following proven science not only save lives, it also can greatly lessen suffering.

- RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.

- Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

- ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

- ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

- ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.">I’m deeply disturbed at HHS Secretary RFK Jr’s dangerous decision to remove all members of vaccine advisory committee and replace them with unqualified people who have a track record of spreading conspiracy and medical misinformation.

The message below was composed by Children&#039;s Health Defense. I agree with the message and am submitting this comment so that you can count  my voice among the many who demand that COVID shots be taken off the market.  This week marks the second anniversary of my brother&#039;s death. He died of sudden cardiac arrest. His medical records and autopsy are consistent with published case reports of sudden death caused by the shots.  I reported his death in VAERS (although I do not have his case number on hand at this moment )

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

As a dentist, i know firsthand the importance of disease prevention and public health. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to protect patients and prevent suffering. It is alarming that in the year 2025 we are focused on tearing down the greatest public health achievement of the 20th century. Rather than focusing on cutting-edge cancer treatments (including some that are being developed in the form of vaccines), it seems that this current administration is hellbent on wasting taxpayer dollars on spreading misinformation about vaccines that have, and continue to, save countless lives (e.g. MMR vaccine, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines). 

1. RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reappoint the previous 17 expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.

2.

Vaccines are important to me and my family. I have participated in clinical trials for several vaccines, including the Pfizer/BioNTech SARS-Cov-2 vaccine, so I understand well how well-tested our vaccines have been. I also believe that my mother&#039;s life was saved by an annual flu vaccine. Without it, flu would have ended her life prematurely when she was dealing with heart failure.

I am writing today to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.I want my grandchildren to have comparable vaccine access that my own daughters were able to have....

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people. 

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
As a physician, my patients benefit greatly from vaccines. Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular a... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

For this ACIP committee meeting, I hope that the vaccines that have already been proven to be safe and effective continue to be approved and made widely available to the public, so that individuals can then make their own decisions. We need access to updated seasonal Flu, RSV, and Covid-19 vaccines for all ages and populations, especially for pregnant women and children, and not just for those over 65. And we need vaccines to be continued to be recommended and covered by insurance. 
For the new ACIP committee members, please uphold this country’s previous high standards of science and public health so we can continue to thrive and not go back to a time where child mortality was excessively high and people died from now-preventable diseases. Many diseases such as Measles are having a resurgence because of under-vaccination in our population. Measles is one of the most contagious viral illnesses and can be deadly especially to unvaccinated children. We need to keep our country healthy, and that means listening to science!

These &quot;vaccines&quot; aren&#039;t helping and protecting children as well as adults, but instead injuries God&#039;s children and humanity. It&#039;s all for profit making and this has nothing to do with health. We don&#039;t need any vaccines but natural immunity.  There are so many deaths and children who committed suicide from being injured especially the HPV shot or Gardasil. I&#039;m appalled and enrage of all those who commit mortal sin.

Once my child could finally get the vaccine because it was finally safe for her age group, I was so proud that even this little person was contributing to herd immunity. To keeping her community safe and covid free. The idea of losing access to these helpful and harmless vaccines is so scary to me. 

Long Covid is real. It exacerbates all existing health issues. And it can create new ones. I think we should do whatever we can to be safe from this potentially disabling illness. It’s better for people and the economy. 

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I have grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all COVID shots from the market.  

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. 

If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing and releasing to the public. 

More and more information is coming out on deaths caused by the COVID vaccines — Myocarditis related issues specifically. I urge you to  do the right thing and ban these vaccinations. It is criminal that these were let through and promoted by our public agencies and politicians when they are dangerous. How could this be allowed to happen? 

Here&#039;s one of many videos out there - Dr. McCullough testifies in front of U.S. Senate 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgNL59TTEuY

The public will become more and more aware about the wrong doing here. I urge the ACIP to d protect the public by withdrawing their recommendation for COVID vaccines. Thank you.">Remove all COVID shots from the market for safety reasons

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

As a graduate student in epidemiology and someone at high risk for severe illness from COVID due to chronic illness, I feel compelled to speak out about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), as announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

These committee members are not just names on a list. They are independent scientists and clinicians with years of expertise. Their role on ACIP is vital: evaluating the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines, shaping insurance coverage policies, and guiding programs like Vaccines for Children, which ensures access for those without coverage. At a time when vaccination rates for diseases like measles, pertussis, and COVID are alarmingly low, their removal is deeply concerning. We are already seeing the consequences, including outbreaks in communities across the country, preventable suffering, and lives lost. It is unthinkable that in 2025, children and adults are still at risk of disability or death from diseases we have the tools to prevent.

The policies being implemented by RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad are actively restricting access to COVID vaccines. As someone who depends on these vaccines to reduce the risk of hospitalization or long-term comp... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Dear RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am a mental health provider in the state of California, but I also care deeply about physical health because I know the two are interconnected.

I&#039;m writing to share my serious concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee.  I believe you know that these terminated members have crucial roles as independent experts scientists or clinicians providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are currently very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. These types of infections have the potential for serious consequences on their health. It is devastating that children could die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Unfortunately, RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have pushed forth policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.   These policies are incredible harmful to the public, as these vaccines are life saving.  The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

My personal but limited experience with the C-19 vaccine is horrifying! The week vaccines were released for elderly people, I watched Richmond VA (WRIC?) news coverage of an elderly vaccine recipient being rolled out from the medical facility and collapse after muttering the words, &quot;I don&#039;t feel well. Something&#039;s not right.&quot; She died according to the 11 o&#039;clock edition of the news that day but that was the last mention of the event I understand!  Adverse events were apparently not allowed to become &#039;news&#039;! 

The only two women I knew who were pregnant had bad outcomes: one a still birth and the other a horribly malformed  infant later diagnosed with &quot;CHARGE Syndrome.

I could relate instance after instance of friends who developed various severe medical conditions after vaccination - even to the point of considering suicide as the only relief from their pain!

 I only pray that ACIP members will take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market unless and until true &#039;gold standard&#039; evidence shows that the benefits outweigh the risks - which we know are NOT the case for the average healthy individual!

The universal availability of covid vaccines is of utmost importance as a robust vaccine program helps me live a more normal life, seeing my adult children, family, and friends.

I am deeply upset my Secretary Kennedy&#039;s removal of ACIP members in order to replace them with &quot;yes-men&quot;..  Obviously this is deeply flawed in terms of both science and policy.  No doubt these new members will downplay the seriousness of covid and hype the faux science around vaccines.  There will be a vacuum of dependable information for people like me to use.  The information that comes out of such a non-independent group is inherently suspect.

And there will be deaths.  Newborn babies whose mothers are refused vaccines are at greater risk, older people, those with health concerns, and sometimes just the unlucky previously-healthy people will fall seriously ill and even die if we embrace a misguided policy of limiting covid vaccines

I live in the UK. I am a classical musician. On New Years Eve 2021 a dear friend and oboist colleague died suddenly after recently having the covid vaccine. She was feeling strange and unwell enough to go to A and E where nothing was found. A short while later she was driving to meet a friend for a country walk. She collapsed while driving. The car stopped next to a field where there was a rugby match. Several of the rugby players were doctors. The air ambulance came but they couldn&#039;t save her. She was a healthy, fit 61 year old with four children and a new grandchild. She was a talented musician and a lovely pers... [truncated]">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. This is unprecedented and these former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. 

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. In 2025, no one should die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines ... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Each of these individuals has a history that directly contradicts ACIP’s mission and scientific standards:
	•	Vicky Pebsworth sits on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, a known source of vaccine misinformation.
	•	Martin Kulldorff has publicly opposed COVID-19 safety measures and refused vaccination while in a public health teaching position.
	•	Retsef Levi has admitted to having minimal vaccine experience, yet made inaccurate claims linking mRNA vaccines to death.
	•	Robert Malone has falsely claimed that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines worsen infection and has aligned himself with conspiracy-driven narratives.

Their public rejection of evidence-based science makes them unfit to serve on a committee that directly influences national vaccine policy. At a time when vaccine confidence is fragile and preventable diseases are returning, appointing individuals with anti-science views would further erode public trust and jeopardize health outcomes.

I urge the committee to reject these nominations and uphold the integrity of ACIP by selecting members who are qualified, experienced, and committed to science-based public health.

I strongly support a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines, and continued widespread access to many types of vaccines for people of all ages. Vaccines recommendations are extremely important for people who rely on insurance coverage to be able to afford these preventatives. Dropping recommendations will mean less access and affordability, meaning rates of vaccination drop, which means that more people can be infected or experience more severe symptoms upon infection, all of which poses a serious risk to me and my family as immunodeficient people. I have already had to spend so much time and energy trying to keep myself safe when many people around me refuse to take preventative measures or measures to prevent infection spread. Even further reducing our societal protections against illness will only continue to isolate and push out people like me from being able to participate in social events. Furthermore, I strongly believe that the ACIP should reverse the decision to remove its panel of experts, and that ACIP members should be required to disclose all conflicts of interest, including financial. Removing expert opinions from processes that people&#039;s health and safety relies on is ridiculous, and replacing them with voices that we are not made aware of the biases and financial incentives behind is dishonest and untrustworthy.">I am an immunocompromised person who has a family member who also has a weakened immune system from other conditions.

She tells me there was a parade in her small town the day a vaccine was announced. My grandmother wasn’t so lucky - she spent several weeks in an iron lung and more weeks recovering before returning to her children, including her 6 month old daughter. While she was away, the children were cared for by my great grandma who also knew the pain of community wide illness and death having lost her army officer brother to the Spanish flu in 1918 days before the Paris Accord. As for me, I escaped community-born  illness because I was vaccinated; my matriarchs - mother, grandmother, great grandmother-  saw to that!

The COVD vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, and to lower one’s chances of dying from COVID. It is critical that mothers, young children, and the community at large have access to this vaccine if they so choose. 

RFK Jr. is running through the health department with a hacksaw and ripping out any information and any experts who stand in his way — at a time when trust in medicine is already at a low. This is not how a government agency should be run. We should be listening to impartial experts — the people who have devoted years of their lives learning and studying, and use actual scientific FACTS to support their claims. 

RFK Jr. must maintain an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.

Information and “data” about COVID vaccines has come out over the last few years that leads people to believe they are dangerous. This information is either presented in misleading ways to stoke fear over an unreal situation, or is blatantly false.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These rest...

The docket specifies “Matters To Be Considered: The agenda will include discussions on anthrax vaccines, chikungunya vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, influenza vaccines, Lyme disease vaccine, meningococcal vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccines for adults, and RSV vaccines for maternal and pediatric populations.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed and emergency-authorized COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet routine and repeated COVID shots are still recommended for large parts of the population. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all other vaccines are suspended until they have been subject to real independent, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before being put on any recommended vaccination schedule.

My daughter lost her life because of the HPV vaccine Gardasil, developing a malignant brain tumor after the third injection (already after the first injection, she started having headaches and getting dizzy, but doctors shook these symptoms off as stress-related). It was impossible to get any doctor to recognise that the deadly medulloblastoma could be caused by the HPV vaccine, so this lethal side effect remained unreported.

Currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective. Children, adults, and pregnant people all rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage. We need a universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually.
Why are you eliminating the ACIP. Your stated that you are going to make it a more Kennedy has expressed concerns about what he perceives as persistent conflicts of interest within the ACIP, suggesting that the committee has become a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for industry profit-taking agendas.
Overhaul of Committee Membership: To address these concerns and restore public trust in vaccines, Kennedy announced a &quot;clean sweep&quot; of the ACIP, removing all 17 existing members. This is obviously weaponizing science against the American people. I sincerely hope you can reconsider your wanton abuse of political power and using your own warped sense of science to justify the path for all Americans. Please be compassionate. Your father, uncles and family were very compassionate, trustworthy and upstanding individuals. I wish the same for you one day.">I do not have a conflict of interest in this issue on vaccines.

I would like to see better research on ALL vaccines.  NIH has the money to fund long term comprehensive studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations. Vaccines are meant to change the immune system for years or decades.  Studies need to follow children for years, even decades and see if there are differences in prevalence of autism,allergies, autoimmune diseases, respiratory illnesses, mental health diagnoses, etc. If the two populations ( vaccinated and unvaccinated) are so different, they can adjust by selecting a vaccinated population that more closely matches the demographic characteristcs of the unvaccinated. We also need good long term studies on individual vaccines, What are the long term ( 10-20 years!) health outcomes for people who got HPV compared with those who did not take HPV.">I am just a regular American, and there are many others like me.

I, along with my wife and children, have kept up with all recommended vaccines, including annual COVID vaccines (which we had during my wife&#039;s pregnancy and when my children were infants). I am happy to say that we have never experienced side effects from the vaccines or notable illness from COVID after having been vaccinated. After reviewing the public health research on this, our experience appears to be typical; this vaccine has been shown to be of minimal risk, and certainly of lower risk than that of COVID itself for unvaccinated individuals. 

With that in mind, I am writing to express my concern with recent changes to the ACIP. I hope that RFK Jr. will reverse the choice to remove expert advisers with decades of relevant experience and instead allow the ACIP to rely on the well-trained doctors and public health researchers who advocate for vaccines.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. I don’t understand how *limiting* access allows people to continue making their own educated choices for themselves and their families. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health and takes away choice. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vacci... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I am an individual with a chronic illness who relies on vaccination one of many vital layers to keep myself safe from COVID reinfection- especially after a harrowing experience with Long COVID where I was unable to function for the better part of a year. The recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is extremely alarming to me. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Access to COVID vaccines in particular must be expanded, not restricted, as COVID continues to evolve and harm public health during this ongoing pandemic. T... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

COVID-19 vaccineABSTRACT
Introduction: Post-COVID-19 conditions have emerged as a global health challenge. This study examined the long- 
term effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the incidence and risk of post-COVID-19 conditions in Japan.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using a database comprising medical claims, COVID-19 
case information, and vaccination records of persons residing in four Japanese municipalities. The cohort 
included COVID-19 cases diagnosed between August 2020 and December 2022. Participants were classified 
according to the duration between their most recent COVID-19 vaccination and COVID-19 occurrence (≽365 
days, 150–364 days, and 14–149 d... [truncated]">Effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the risk of developing post-COVID

It is vaccines that will continue to keep things in such a state given that so much of the populace does not wish to mask anymore. To take away vaccines from the general population and reserve it for the elderly is to bar access to the people that will need and get the most use out of it. There should certainly be a reserve for the elderly who want it, but they also constitute a large majority of the people who would refuse the vaccine either on principle or because of legitimate health reasons. It is frontline workers who need it the most, which in turn will protect such elderly people in the times that they are most likely to be exposed to the disease (when doing every day shopping) anyways.">COVID vaccines must be available to the entire populace for whom it is safe to have it administered.

These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are quite low. Because of this, many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and have potentially lifelong impacts on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and anyone who wants one.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. By creating barriers to access, the health of everyone will be impacted. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID v...

All COVID-19 shots should be pulled from the market immediately. You can&#039;t concoct a formula for something that is constantly mutating. Even if you did get the formula right, the delivery mechanism is inherently dangerous. Injecting lipid nanoparticles that can stick together can create emboli that can be deadly within a matter of minutes. The cationic lipids used in the concoctions are toxic and can build up in ovaries, negatively affecting fertility. There is confirmed DNA contamination from the plasmids involved in manufacturing that can disrupt genes and lead to cancer. When the delivered mRNA starts getting translated into the spike protein by cells, cytotoxic t-cells will destroy those cells, resulting in varying degrees of tissue damage and pathology. Cytotoxic t-cells can&#039;t stop all the protein production, so the spike protein does get made and secreted into the blood. The spike proteins don&#039;t just float around waiting for antibodies to be made... they are biologically active and will attach to cellular receptors, creating an inflammatory immune response that can damage more tissues, leading to known vascular and neurological problems. All because you want to make serum antibodies that can&#039;t protect the person from becoming infected, can&#039;t stop the infection from spreading to others, and will exacerbate symptoms through various known mechanisms.

The last time I was reinfected with COVID, it took a full four months to get back to my previous health baseline. As someone who has often encountered doctors who don’t understand my symptoms or have effective treatments to offer, I understand the skepticism and disillusionment with the medical industry that motivates many anti-vaccine activists. But it is one thing to choose not to vaccinate oneself and another to deprive others of the choice to be vaccinated. I know that the more COVID circulates in the population, the more precarious my own life and health become. COVID-19 vaccines have been statistically proven to reduce the risk of long COVID, which recently surpassed asthma as the most common chronic illness in children. I ask you to restore the integrity of ACIP through the following: 

1. RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
2. Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
3. ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine re...

The ACIP has been the highly regarded cornerstone of the US vaccine program.  The process for being selection to this committee is arduous with very strict attention paid to varied expertise and conflicts of interest.  Recommendations are issued after an evidence based, open process which is streamed to the public live and which can be attended by members of the public.  Member are rotated onto the committee at two yearly intervals to ensure continuity and retention of knowledge from prior presentations.  Members weigh the benefits and harms for a vaccine under consideration for specific age groups and the population as a whole.  Health insurance to cover vaccine cost and free vaccines for half the children born in the US are tied to these recommendations.  Following a recommendation for use, the ACIP reviews post licensure safety data to examine rare safety issues that may arise,  This process works etxremely well.   In 1999, use of the first rotavirus vaccine was temporarily paused pending a study which eventually linked the vaccine to intussusception.  The vaccine was ultimately withdrawn from the market.

In these three roles, I am a caregiver for some of the most vulnerable members of our society who benefit immensely not only from the protection provided by vaccination, but also from the protection of herd immunity when the majority of people choose to vaccinate.

And so today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are concerningy low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences or even death. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots.

	1.	Expand the Novavax BLA by removing the requirement that it only be used for individuals with underlying conditions. COVID-19 vaccines should be universally accessible, and Novavax offers a critical option for those seeking a protein-based platform.
	2.	Authorize strain targeting for JN.1, consistent with WHO recommendations. Novavax’s saponin-based adjuvant has demonstrated protection against circulating subvariants and should be allowed to stay current.
	3.	Adjust the timing of strain selection earlier in the year to align with the school calendar. This will help ensure vaccine availability by the end of summer, enabling better protection for students and staff at the start of the academic year.
	4.	Support expedited approval for children and broaden Novavax’s access across all age groups. A non-mRNA option is important for many families and could help improve pediatric vaccination rates.
	5.	Permit a new primary series with Novavax for anyone, including those who have not yet started vaccination or are seeking to restart with a non-mRNA platform.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The former committee members played an important role in setting vaccine schedules, insurance coverage, and evaluating evidence and efficacy. I’d ask the CDC to remain politically neutral and make decisions based on the evidence, which is: there is absolutely no evidence that vaccines cause autism. All scientifically sound evidence shows that vaccines make us all healthier. The measles outbreak in Texas has shown how quickly we could take vaccines for granted, and how important it is for agencies like the CDC and individuals like RFK Jr. and his subordinates to follow the science on vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines have allowed so many of us to regain normalcy after the pandemic. Measles vaccines and so many other vaccines have stopped illnesses that once were common in their tracks.

Over the past year, I’ve had a friend develop whooping cough because of an outbreak due to decreased vaccination levels. My great uncle was in a wheelchair my whole life because of polio. In the past year, my uncle, one cousin, and a family friend have had shingles outbreaks — which I’ll never have to worry about because I received a chicken pox vaccine...

In March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic started to wreak havoc in the United States, we had minimal tools to prevent the onslaught of hospitalizations and deaths. There was hope for heard immunity, but this requires surviving the infection. Many people who survived continued to experience symptoms that lasted for months, potentially leading to disability.

Yes, the COVID vaccines have side effects, but the side effects are far less severe than the infection itself. There was a drastic decline in hospitalizations and deaths once the vaccines were released. The vaccine is what enabled us to go on living our lives as we had before the pandemic. 

Viruses are constantly mutating to find new ways to infect us. It’s important that we stay on top of medical advances that continue to prolongue our life expectancy and quality of life. We need vaccines.">I’m writing as a nurse practitioner and a concerned citizen. I have no financial interest in vaccines.

One week prior is not enough time for public feedback.

As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important tools for addressing SARS-CoV-2. Universal access to updated COVID vaccines is needed to address the ongoing variants. Additionally, vaccines must be recommended for individuals of all ages and be fully covered by public funds/or insurance at a regular interval of at least every six months.

The vaccine schedule should address waning efficacy in the months following vaccination [1-3] as well as the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains. FDA decisions will affect the current and future vaccine approach, including what healthcare providers recommend, what health insurance covers, and the level of public engagement.

Restricting access to these vaccinations, at any level, neglects the responsibility to protect everyone, as anyone is vulnerable to a COVID infection that could lead to severe health outcomes or Long COVID. Given that there is the potential to update the vaccines to better match perpetually emerging variants, updates to all vaccine types are needed, and ensuring access to all options made by all three manufacturers is very important.

I am gravely concerned about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

   So what changed between 1976 and now, when almost 40,000 people have already died due to mRNA shot??  So many young people have &quot;Suddenly dropped dead&quot;. Does it take having your own child drop dead in order to get rid of these deadly shots?  
   I believe the difference between 1976 &amp; now, is how &quot;captured&quot; the decision makers are, by big Pharma. Lets just make it right NOW!   
     And are we going to wait until Austistic  children are 1 out of 2 births?  There are NO studies that look for the results of putting 74+ shots into each kid. That is totally insane!  It is time to take the power away from big Pharma... [truncated]">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

It is also unclear to the public how these nominations will be judged given that the entire ACIP, including the Secretariat responsible for reviewing applicants and nominees, has been disbanded.

ACIP plays a critical role in shaping vaccine policy in the United States — guiding decisions that directly impact public health, safety, and trust in science. Appointing individuals who reject the scientific consensus on vaccines undermines the integrity of the committee’s work and threatens the health of millions of Americans, particularly the most vulnerable: infants, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly.

As a parent, I have so many fears to how my child may be injured or die, but the threat of disease is not one of them because of vaccines. 
Vaccinations are the main reason so many children survive to thrive in the US. The experts at the CDC are essential to supporting and protecting the population of the United States. The US used to lead the world in vaccine development and helped eradicate diseases like smallpox and polio. It would be a gross neglect of the citizens of the USA and ethically irresponsible to remove any vaccines from the general population. 
COVID-19 is a particularly virulent illness with long-term effects that are still being discovered today. An easily accessible, safe, and abundant vaccine for this disease will prevent a national or worldwide economic collapse as happened during the pandemic outbreak in 2020 &amp; 2021.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I live with family who are and I am immunocompromised myself. Furthermore, I know indiscriminate access to vaccines can and should be a standard of American life. Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Ever... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I am a U.S.A. citizen how has been living abroad in Sweden for the last more than five years. But, I follow the politics and issues of my native U.S.A.

I am writing to encourage widespread continued access to Covid vaccines.  I am a 57 year old healthy woman who has never been diagnosed with Covid-19 and who has enthusiastically accessed all available Covid vaccines and boosters.  I very much want to be able to eat meals and gather indoors with my 90 year old father this winter.  Therefore, I strongly urge the following:

1) CDC and ACIP expert advisors must support widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of safe and effective vaccines, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

2) Currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective. Children, adults, and pregnant people all rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

3) We need a universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually.

Please do NOT restrict access to vaccines that are cost effective.  The vast majority of Americans are like me and want unfettered access to vaccines without out of pocket costs.  

Thank you!">To CDC and ACIP:

RE: Docket Number CDC-2025-0024-0001 (Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices)
 
To Whom It May Concern:

I am an American citizen employed by an NCI-designated cancer center, and I have very strong concerns about the recent activities related to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the posted agenda of this meeting. 

I feel that the replacement of the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices less than two weeks before this meeting removes continuity and creates uncertainty in the ability of the committee to accomplish its expressed agenda at this public meeting.
The docket specifies 3 days and a number of viruses. However the draft published agenda at https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-18.pdf indicates the meeting will only be 2 days instead of the originally planned 3 days. It also suggests that discussions will only include: vaccines for COVID, influenza, RSV, MMRV, anthrax, and Chikungunya. It will only include recommendation votes for influenza and RSV (maternal/pediatric, and Vaccines for Children) vaccines.

My concern is that removing these important discussions and votes in a public meeting serves to side-step the standard process for review and denying the transparency owed to the U.S. people regarding vaccine data, di... [truncated]">Ms. Stephanie Thomas

RE: Covid vacciantions. RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful. Everyone deserves regular access to updated COVID vaccines with wide availabilility and full coverage by health insurance, Medicaid and Medicare. The scientific evidence is irrefutable regarding the cumulative dangers of COVID, repeated infections and Long COVID. It is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. I am asking you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.

All of them are vaccine skeptics and hold no authority whatsoever in the Scientific Community. We also know vaccines do not cause autism, which seems to be these nominee&#039;s only talking point. 
ACIP plays a critical role in shaping vaccine policy in the United States — guiding decisions that directly impact public health, safety, and trust in science. Appointing individuals who reject the scientific consensus on vaccines undermines the integrity of the committee’s work and threatens the health of millions of Americans, particularly the most vulnerable: infants, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. Herd immunity through vaccinations are the only way to protect our most vulnerable populations. 
We are already seeing the consequences of anti-vaccine rhetoric in the U.S.: we have a growing number of cases of diseases we have ERADICATED ALREADY. Measles, chicken pox, polio and others.
I urge the committee to reject these nominations and instead uphold the science-based standards that have long defined ACIP’s role. The health of our communities depend on it.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express serious concern about the recent dismissal of all 17 members of the CDC’s ACIP committee, as announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. This committee provides vital scientific and medical guidance to ensure vaccines approved by the FDA are safe, effective, and accessible. It also helps determine which vaccines are covered by insurance and the Vaccines for Children program.

Vaccination rates are still too low, and we&#039;re seeing outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles, whooping cough, and COVID. These illnesses can lead to severe and lasting health problems, especially for unvaccinated children and adults. No child should suffer or die because they can’t get affordable vaccines. We need strong support for vaccines like COVID, HPV, flu, meningococcal, and RSV to protect public health.

I am especially concerned about the recent limits placed on access to COVID vaccines. Everyone needs regular access to updated COVID shots, and these vaccines must be widely available and covered by insurance. The evidence is clear: getting a COVID vaccine within the past year lowers the risk of getting sick, being hospitalized, or dying — for people of all ages, even those who are otherwise healthy. The new policies restrict access to these vaccines, especially for children, pregnant people, and adults under 65, and they send mixed messages about the science. These restrictions are not supp...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

However, I do not have confidence in anything RFK Jr. says or does. If RFK Jr&#039;s namesake were alive today, a great man, he would be ashamed of his son for being a sockpuppet for Trump.

He&#039;s a pathetic &quot;man&quot; with a horrible agenda that will set the American people back DECADES, thanks to his foolishness and ignorance.

We know that vaccines lower the risk of getting severe disease or death. They also help reduce transmission and lower the risk of developing long term issues from viruses. We need affordable or free access for everyone who wants them to protect themselves and people like me.

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.


Thank you,

There has not been any transparency regarding the qualifications or potential conflicts of interest of future ACIP members.  This sets a very dangerous precedent for the wellbeing of our society.  
The reason many unvaccinated people have remained healthy is due to herd immunity.  Herd immunity is when everyone around the unvaccinated person is vaccinated &amp; this protects the unvaccinated individual from getting sick. Now, we are already experiencing decreased vaccine levels (below 95% and much lower in some areas), and this is the reason Measles cases are the highest in at least 30 years.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to every single person&#039;s health. Everyone must have regular and affordable access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidenc... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

I am writing to express my strong support for the critical role this committee plays in protecting public health through evidence-based vaccine recommendations. In a time when misinformation about vaccines is rampant and increasingly dangerous, it is more important than ever that ACIP remains grounded in rigorous science and led by qualified public health experts.

The anti-vaccine movement has already caused measurable harm, leading to resurgences of preventable diseases, eroding public trust, and placing vulnerable populations at risk. This movement is not grounded in science or public health. It thrives on fear, conspiracy, and politicization of medical facts. We cannot afford to let ideology replace expertise in matters that affect millions of lives.

Vaccines are among the most thoroughly studied medical interventions in history. Their safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again. ACIP’s role in evaluating data, assessing risk, and offering guidance is essential and it must be preserved from political interference.

It is vital that this committee be staffed and supported by experienced scientists, immunologists, epidemiologists, and public health professionals, not individuals with unscientific or ideologically driven agendas. Public confidence depends on the credibility and integrity of those who guide vaccine policy.

Further, ensuring widespread vaccine availability is essential for safeguarding public health and achieving eq... [truncated]">To the members of ACIP,

I am commenting to ask for the following:

That RFK Jr reverse his decision to remove the highly qualified advisors on the independent vaccine committee. While I doubt he will as his terrible anti-vaccination views are well known, I still urge the reinstatements.

Given the unlikelihood of my core ask, I do point out that any new appointees must be free of financial conflicts of interest. Anything else will prove to the country RFK Jr is not acting in best interests of the health of Americans. This includes individuals currently making money claiming vaccines are unsafe (demonstrably false) in any way. This includes appearances at organizations and panels claiming false medical information, as well as all partnerships with any donors, organizations, and businesses supporting anti-vaccination narratives and &#039;wellness alternatives&#039;.

Any new composition of AICIP must support full access to all vaccinations, agree vaccinations are safe and medically important for individual and community health, and in particular continue recommending all age access to Covid vaccines at least twice a year.

Medically we have learned our current vaccines do confer decade(s) long protections. Research must continue, particularly the promising nasal vaccinations, to offer all Americans greater health protections. In the meantime, full access to new formulations is required to save lives and productive health outcomes.

Failing that, I think RFK Jr should stop making a mockery of the long me... [truncated]">Hello,

I appreciate the opportunity to provide public comment on the COVID-19 vaccines for the 2025-2026 cycle.

As an immunocompromised senior, having access to safe and effective vaccines is vital. Initially, I chose the mRNA Moderna series, but after switching to the Protein Subunit Novavax vaccine, I had a much better experience—avoiding the three-day malaise I experienced with Moderna. My research indicates that Novavax offers greater durability and reduced reactogenicity, allowing for fewer and more spaced-out doses. However, inconsistent communication regarding availability has been challenging.

To improve public health, I urge you to consider the following recommendations:

- Maintain a universal vaccination recommendation for all age groups.
- Move the release of vaccines to summer, given the ongoing risks from variants.
- Ensure full insurance coverage with no out-of-pocket costs.
- Reinstate the BRIDGE access program.

Thank you for your attention to these important issues.

Sincerely,  
A Concerned Senior Committed to Public Health">To the ACIP Committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people. 
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with f... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

You can&#039;t inject health 
Vaccines are a scam 
Stop pushing this criminal product on children 
Bring back vaccine liability 
Health comes from within 
* it is interesting to note people who don&#039;t believe in vaccines , believe in God as God put the medicine in the plant kingdom.  People who believe in vaccines don&#039;t believe in God and believe in science. 

Plants and God created fruits are MAGICAL and heal from within and prevent and cure cancer and all sorts 

The answer is in the plant kingdom and making sure everyone has their health elements in the normal range not injecting fetal DNA and aluminium and all sorts of dangerous chemicals that cause brain damage like narcissistim , allergies,  asthma,  sudden infant death , the list goes on and on

The new type of vaccines now are not vaccines at all but mrna nano tecnology.  

Absolutely criminal what is going on 

I am on the side of God and I pray that people start learning about health and move away from dangerous injections like vaccines

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important...</td>

1. CDC ACIP expert advisors must support widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of safe and effective vaccines.

2. Currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective. Children, adults, and pregnant people all rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

3. We need a universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually.

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.
I will never take a vaccine until double blind inert placebo studies have been done, published and released to the American public for review.  I have lost all faith and confidence in the medical and pharmaceutical industries.  Our health and our children are the most precious possessions we have.  God will judge what you do in regards to protecting the lives of Americans.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Because of doubts sown by anti-vaccination groups, such as Children’s Health Defense, many Americans fear vaccinations, leading to lower vaccination rates for many infectious diseases and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr. is ignoring science and bending studies to fit his anti-vaxx agenda. We’ve already seen how his false narrative about the safety of vaccines can impact communities with the recent measles outbreak, which was made exponentially worse by low vaccination rates. 

The COVD vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, and to lower one’s chances of dying from COVID. It is critical that mothers, young children, and the community at large have access to this vaccine if they so choose. 

RFK Jr. is running through the health department with a hacksaw and ripping out any information and any experts who stand in his way — at a time when trust in medicine is already at a low. This is not how a government agency should be run. We should be listening to impartial experts — the people who have devoted years of their lives learning and studying, and use actual scientific FACTS to support their claims. 

1.	RFK Jr. must maintain an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.
2.	Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

As a health care provider (nurse) with over 30 years experience the movement to limit and/or eliminate vaccines is concerning. 
Statistics from notable healthcare agencies in the U.S. and the research behind the stats support the efficacy of vaccines. 
I am worried that these limitations will affect those with chronic illness, those with physical disabilities, the elderly, and young children and teens. 
I feel that vaccines (including the Covid vaccine) shouldn&#039;t be made mandatory, nor should it be restricted or forbidden. 
Every person should have a choice to accept or refuse. 
There are those that don&#039;t have access to health care, which is also a problem. 
I am exploring you to keep our CDC, NIH, APIC, and other scientific agencies working. We need their guidance. 
Thank you.">To Whom it May Concern:
As a health care provider (nurse) with over 30 years experience the movement to limit and/or eliminate vaccines is concerning. 
Statistics from notable healthcare agencies in the U.S. and the research behind the stats support the efficacy of vaccines.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.
  The evidence is overwhelming. Continuing the charade that these experimental shots are safe will merely cause further loss of confidence in an already badly damaged health care industry.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

As the NB. 1.8.1 strain of COVID—known for causing what people describe as “swallowing glass” [1]—spreads globally, I am asking ACIP to support widespread and unhindered vaccination for all Americans. COVID infections continue to kill and disable countless Americans, scientific evidence clearly indicates we need universal access to updated COVID vaccines to protect against constantly mutating variants. Research also shows updated vaccines are necessary every six months (at a minimum, as efficacy wanes after three months), and should be recommended for everyone who can receive them, regardless of age or pregnancy. 
Restricting access to these vaccinations neglects ACIP’s responsibility to protect everyone from COVID infections that frequently lead to severe health outcomes or Long COVID. Given that there is the potential to update the vaccines to better match perpetually emerging variants, updates to all vaccine types are needed, and ensuring access to all options made by all three manufacturers (Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax) is essential. 
Any recommendations that regard who or when access is available to these vaccines are barriers for vulnerable people and discourage high risk people from getting needed vaccine boosters.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Now polio and other diseases can be prevented by vaccines that have been used for decades and proven safe by scientific standards. 

I now work as a scientific editor and intimately understand the rigor with which reputable journals are required to operate, disclosures around competing interests, ethics, etc. I understand the scientific evidence and I strongly support the widespread availability of vaccines for free for children and adults. 

Having spent my entire career working in academia and the non-profit sector (non-profit publishers) I have found recent rhetoric around scientists, scientific publishers, and their motives to be incredibly harmful and offensive. I have been VERY concerned about actions taken by RFK since becoming HHS secretary and demand the following:

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.
Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am begging you to please do anything you can to keep universal access to COVID vaccines. I am kept up at night at the thought that the vaccines could be taken away or have limited access and the health of my daughter and immunocompromised family could be at risk. 

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. We ask you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine f...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.

Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines.

We have fact based evidence of what Covid does to people, especially those immunocompromised or otherwise at greater risk of illness, and yet continue to brush off Covid as if it were a lesser illness. It is irresponsible and negligent to restrict access to the Covid vaccine and subsequent boosters to keep our people healthy and protected from this preventable illness. The vaccine is safe and effective, and it is currently available to us. Taking it away will not help anyone. It will only cause harm, a direct violation and perversion of what medicine should stand for- “First, do no harm.”">It has been made abundantly clear that vaccines save lives.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including healthy people. Ideally they should be available to those who want them twice a year, as that is the length of time where immunity wanes. 
The new policies limit COVID vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also sow uncertainty and doubt about COVID vaccines, while there is no scientific basis for the restrictions.

But leaving the public unprotected or having to jump through hoops in order to actually get the vaccine or have to pay out of pocket, is an absolute dereliction of duty. EVERYONE over 6 must be allowed to get the vaccine!

Reducing the availability to Covid vaccines WILL COST LIVES. That is absolutely undebateable. Those of us who want it, have taken it, have seem improvements in long Covid symptoms and stayed safe, understand the supposed risks. It is absolutely unquestionable that the worst case risks of the vaccines are far worse than the worst case risks of getting Covid, especially if you have other health risks-- which after catching Covid multiple times in the last half decade I would argue most Americans now have.

Vaccinations are a critical safety tool that the entire public should be afforded the opportunity to have access to. Perhaps what is most important is that insurance companies cover what the committee recommends. It is imperative that that committee continue to recommend all manner of vaccines including (but not limited to) MMR, HPV, flu, and RSV. 

Vaccines save lives and are cost efficient and effective measures that reduce the strain on the overall healthcare system. A potentially chronic disease prevented with a vaccine saves resources that can go to other urgent matters, allows individuals to participate in society, helps to stimulate the economy, and includes any other number of positive outcomes. 

It’s also important to focus explicitly on the Covid-19 vaccine, including Novavax. Covid-19 and Long Covid have taken millions out of the workforce and Covid continues to do untold damages to the population, again, putting strains on our limited resources. While a portion of those with Long Covid contracted it before any vaccines were available (if only vaccines were available earlier), the mixed messaging and inconsistent recommendations surrounding the covid-19 vaccine can make individuals hesitant to take the vaccine. Almost more importantly, though, those that want the vaccine cannot get it or cannot afford it if it is not recommended by this committee. It is of utmost importance that this committee recommend this vaccine for everyone. Studies conti... [truncated]">Docket CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
The COVID-19 pandemic left every human on Earth feeling vulnerable. For those of us who want to protect ourselves and loved ones, that means doing the work to understand this new virus and everything else about the world that changed because of it. When the world opened back up after the majority of folks were vaccinated, a lot of people thought that we had defeated the pandemic. We soon learned that the pandemic was not over, but the virus mutated and vaccine protection waned in response. As we continued to discover more and more, we learned that vaccines were helpful, not harmful, and were a baseline in a multi-layer defense against the virus from destroying our families and disabling many people in the long term. 
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious dise... [truncated]">See attached file(s)Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 
Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

Additionally, recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. Everyone who chooses to must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

This decision is part of a troubling pattern that risks silencing the scientific voices that healthcare providers and families rely on and creating confusion about vaccines that have saved millions of lives. 
 
The strength of our public health system depends not only on data but also on the integrity of the decision-making process. When expert voices are removed or incorrectly labeled as untrustworthy, it sends a dangerous message at a time when misinformation is already putting lives at risk.

Which side of history do you want your legacy to fall on?  It will all come out eventually.  Then what?  I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. The science is proving more and more that these covid shots are causing major problems.  You will be culpable if you continue to allow them to be used.  Read that sentence twice.  In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. Swo why haven&#039;t the covid shots been pulled as of yet?

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing with very serious concerns about proposals to limit COVID vaccine access. As a cancer survivor in my early 30s, I know that debilitating and disabling illness can happen to anyone at any age. Because of that experience, I know it is vital that all people have full access to tools that can prevent them from developing a condition like Long COVID, which severely impacts a person&#039;s ability to lead the life they want to lead. Additionally, I visit and help care for my father, who has two forms of cancer. Because of his increased vulnerability to infection, I want to be sure I am well-protected from infections like COVID so that I do not pass on an illness that could have serious and evenly deadly consequences for him.

Everyone should have the freedom and the choice to make health care decisions that best protect themselves and their loved ones, and these proposed changes trample on that freedom.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized va...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

My name is Lane Ilstrup and I&#039;m a young adult living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since birth I have benefited from public infrastructure granting me the right to vaccines that prevent infectious disease. This was lifesaving always, and especially since 2020 with the onset of COVID-19 it was regular access to vaccines and boosters without cost that allowed me any protection against COVID. Since then I contracted COVID-19 once and it was my regular vaccinations that allowed me to survive it as an immunocompromised adult. So, this issue is deeply personal to me individually and to me as a member of our society - today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such a...

Prioritizing only older adults ignores robust evidence that younger and previously healthy individuals can also suffer severe or long-term consequences.
2. Recommend at least annual—ideally bi‑annual—boosters
Vaccine-induced immunity, particularly from mRNA vaccines, wanes substantially within 2–4 months

Booster doses timed to pre‑surge or variant activity can preserve protection and curb transmission.
Some jurisdictions already support biannual boosters; aligning with that approach would ensure cohesive public health strategy .

Gaps in insurance coverage should not impede public health; vaccine equity is essential.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. Nor should adults like me, who have chronic illnesses and weakened immune systems, have to fear additional health complications because strangers around us are carrying vaccine-prevantable diseases. 

Additionally, policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations create barriers that are harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regul... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Vaccines are safe and effective, and they remain one of the most important tools in protecting public health. This includes both the COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccines, whose current ingredients are well-studied and safe for the general population. It is also crucial to acknowledge that vaccines do not cause autism.

It is critical that anyone who wishes to receive a vaccination—whether COVID-19, influenza, or otherwise—should be able to do so freely and without artificial restriction. Canada continues to allow COVID-19 vaccination for all individuals over six months of age, regardless of risk profile. The United States should follow suit and protect the right of individuals to make informed decisions in consultation with their healthcare providers. 

I am also alarmed by the coordinated brigading of this docket by supporters of Children’s Health Defense (CHD), a group known for promoting vaccine misinformation. The organization&#039;s historical ties to the current Secretary of Health and Human Services further raise conflict of interest concerns. Many of these comments appear to be copied from one another, do not reflect scientific consensus, and should be considered in that context.

I am submitting this public comment to respectfully but firmly express my profound opposition to the recent dismissal of all 17 ACIP members and to the reported changes in COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

The ACIP has historically served as a cornerstone of public health, providing crucial, evidence-based guidance on immunization practices for decades. The expertise, institutional knowledge, and rigorous scientific review process provided by the previous committee members were invaluable. Their abrupt dismissal has stripped the committee of essential experience and continuity, creating a vacuum that cannot be adequately filled by individuals lacking sufficient background in this highly specialized field. I strongly urge the reinstatement of the previously appointed ACIP members to ensure that future vaccine recommendations are grounded in the highest standards of scientific integrity and public health expertise.

Furthermore, I am deeply concerned by the reported changes to the COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, particularly for healthy children and pregnant women, that appear to have been made without the robust scientific data and transparent review process that is characteristic of the ACIP&#039;s historical operations. Public health policy, especially regarding vaccines, must always be driven by comprehensive, peer-reviewed science and a thorough assessment of...

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am a teacher who relies on vaccine protection for myself, my students, and my immunocompromised family members.

I am very concerned about the future of ACIP and access to vaccines in the US.

I am writing to ask RFK, Jr. to reverse the firing of the 17 members of the ACIP committee and to ensure access to vaccines for all this fall, including COVID vaccines like Novavax. Access to these vaccines is essential to front line members of our society like teachers.

Please return to science-based decision-making in an open and transparent process.

Thank you.">To RFK, Jr. and the members of the Committee,

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I write this as an impassioned constituent who has many immunocompromised family members and fear for how long covid may impact them. I write as someone who cares about the people they share the planet with.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to update... [truncated]">URGENT: To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

Vaccines are a fantastic medical advancement that has saved countless lives and they should be more readily available to the public.
The ACIP members who were fired by RFK Jr. should be reinstated and RFK Jr. should resign. 

Restricting access to vaccines and making them unaffordable benefits no one and will cost countless lives. We&#039;ve already witnessed how damaging diseases such as Covid-19 have on our nation&#039;s population, economy, and work force. Healthy citizens are only a net positive. Anything other than keeping citizens healthy will have disastrous consequences in the long term for very little short term gain.

Public Comment for the June 25–27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP Committee:

I have no financial conflicts of interest to disclose. I’m a parent of two school-aged children—my 11-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son, who is neurodivergent and lives with ADHD, DMDD, and autism spectrum disorder. I rely on public health systems like the CDC to protect my family—not politicize our health.

The COVID vaccine has helped us return to school, work, and community life with less fear. While none of us are immunocompromised, we value the ability to prevent serious illness and protect those around us. Access to updated vaccines—COVID and beyond—should not be restricted based on politics or misinformation. All children, pregnant people, and adults deserve the right to science-backed protection.

The removal of the full ACIP membership and the appointment of individuals pushing anti-science agendas is deeply alarming. We cannot afford to lose trust in vaccine policy just to satisfy political narratives.

I urge you to:

Reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for all ages, including children and pregnant people.

Maintain open, science-based, and transparent decision-making at ACIP.

Ensure financial and ideological conflicts of interest are disclosed by new committee members.

The COVID-19 pandemic was a frightening time for people like me. When the vaccine was released, and I was able to get fully vaccinated, I felt safer. It was an immense relief. The science is clear and compelling: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. We need a universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually.

I am once again concerned for the safety of vulnerable people who are in situations like mine. I am especially concerned for children who are unable to receive vaccines because of medical conditions or infants for whom vaccines are not indicated. They rely on the communal efforts of people around them to keep them safe and healthy. They rely on others getting vaccinated. This is why personal distrust in vaccines is anything but personal. Currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective. Children, adults, and pregnant people all rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

These individuals do not fulfill the requirements for serving as an ACIP member as each of them has a well-documented history of spreading vaccine misinformation. One has even publicly admitted that he has minimal vaccine experience despite the requirement of needing to possess “an understanding of the vaccination and immunization issues covered by the ACIP”:

Vicky Pebsworth - She serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that has widely been criticized as a source of vaccine misinformation.

Martin Kulldorff - After refusing the COVID-19 vaccine while in a teaching position, he pushed for relaxing COVID-19 restrictions for low-risk groups at the height of the pandemic which is an unethical public health practice.

Retsef Levi - He has admitted, himself, that he has minimal vaccine experience yet he publicly wrote inaccurately that the mRNA vaccine causes death.

Robert W. Malone - He has incorrectly suggested that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could worsen infection.

These candidates, nominated by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have publicly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines, promoted debunked conspiracy theories, and aligned themselves with anti-science movem...

Public Comment Submission to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  The California Pharmacists Association (CPhA) represents thousands of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and student pharmacists across all pharmacy practice settings, including community, health-system, ambulatory care, specialty, long-term care, public health, managed care, and more throughout California. As the largest state pharmacy association in the nation, CPhA submits this public comment with urgency and strong conviction in support of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and its indispensable role in shaping science-based vaccine policy and protecting public health. The recent dismissal of all ACIP members by HHS Secretary Robert F . Kennedy Jr. is a politically motivated action that undermines six decades of rigorous scientiﬁc process and endangers the integrity of immunization recommendations relied upon nationwide. ACIP recommendations are not merely academic. They are foundational to pharmacy practice and have direct implications for patient access and insurance coverage. Pharmacists across the country are authorized immunizers, administering millions of doses annually in accordance with ACIP schedules. These recommendations are used by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), state Medicaid programs, and private insurers to determine vaccine coverage and reimbursement.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. As a passionate advocate for public health and a firm believer in the power of science and evidence-based practices, I feel compelled to express my deep concerns regarding the recent termination of the 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, which was announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The value of independent scientific and medical expertise on this committee cannot be overstated, as it plays a vital role in guiding vaccine access, safety, and policy decisions. Without this guidance, vulnerable communities risk being left behind and put at unnecessary risk.

I have witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of inadequate access to vaccines. I have seen the effects of COVID, influenza, polio, measles, cholera and Ebola - to name a few, including the unnecessary deaths from those outbreaks. I have a family member who died from cervical cancer, which now has an HPV vaccine to save people from this fate. These diseases can have lifelong consequences, and it’s heartbreaking to see people suffer when there’s a simple way to prevent it.

Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines. We owe it to the future generation to take what...

That is NO reason for them all to be dismissed.  These people whose job it is to make decisions about vaccine guidelines, in an apolitical, scientifically methodical way.  Which administration they were appointed under cannot be used as an indictment against them and their qualifications and competence.  In fact, up until now, ACIP has had a long history of full public disclosure of potential conficts of interest while this new panel does NOT.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting 

The health of all peoples throughout the world are dependent on vaccines. Why would the US Government limit or deny anyone access to vaccines. This action to limit or deny vaccines to anyone is an act of human cruelty against not only the citizens of the United States but the world. Records that vaccines work are available. Many diseases have been virtually eradicated due to the availability of vaccines. However now with restrictions being put on vaccines, diseases that my children who are now adults have never been exposed to will see that their children will be in danger of contracting due to vaccine restrictions. This is a complete step backwards is incomprehensible. How dare you, the government of the country I’ve been living in, dedicated to, paid my taxes, contributed to a positive life, promoted my country by being a part of a functioning society which now is choosing to do irreparable harm to millions of people throughout the world. 
Where are your morals! Search your soul and be true to what is right for millions and millions of people!!!!!
Keep vaccines available, keep vaccine research active and a priority for public safety. 
All of our lives depend upon vaccines!">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to insist that COVID vaccines and other lifesaving vaccines remain available to the American people. With many medical and scientific professionals in my family, I am highly aware of the benefits of vaccination for protecting vulnerable populations against preventable diseases. Vaccines are effective and safe, and to remove broad access to vaccines for COVID, influenza, and other diseases will have a dire impact on the communities you wish to serve and support. In the interest of medical freedom, I demand that citizens continue to have the option to receive vaccines for the sake of our health and those around us. 

I also have grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease...

Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a ...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These rest...

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy’s proposal to end the government’s existing Covid vaccine recommendation for healthy pregnant women, if enacted, will be a major setback to decades’ worth of efforts to advance the health of pregnant people and their babies.

It also profoundly unethical.

Pregnant people are consistently left behind in biomedical R&amp;D in ways that are deeply harmful to the health of both mother and child. In the decade before the Covid pandemic, consensus reports emerged denouncing this pregnancy evidence gap and providing road maps for how to ethically generate evidence during pregnancy within the confines of existing research regulations. I co-led one of these efforts, the PREVENT project, initiated in response to the Zika epidemic and completed in fall 2019. PREVENT specifically focused on how to ethically include pregnant women in the development and deployment of new vaccines for emerging pandemic threats.">By Ruth R. FadenJune 3, 2025

The CDC should be researching the new variants and making vaccines accordingly- and then offering suggestions as to whom should get them.

Vicky Pebsworth - She serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that has widely been criticized as a source of vaccine misinformation.

Martin Kulldorff - After refusing the COVID-19 vaccine while in a teaching position, he pushed for relaxing COVID-19 restrictions for low risk groups at the height of the pandemic which is an unethical public health practice.

Retsef Levi - He has admitted, himself, that he has minimal vaccine experience yet he publicly wrote inaccurately that the mRNA vaccine causes death.

Robert W. Malone - He has incorrectly suggested that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could worsen infection.

    Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

    To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

    I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

    Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about  of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

    RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available wit... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Counter to RFK’s eugenics, it is a very big deal if even “only” the disabled, elderly, and vulnerable are affected by disease. Eugenics has no place in medicine!!!!

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.

Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least annually.">I knew multiple people, who had they been vaccinated, might not have died from COVID.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express my concern regarding the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as the measles. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence clearly indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important ...
