With this in mind, it would make the most logical and financial sense to sustain policies and protections that invest in our workers safety and health, thus broader vaccine access is needed to ensure people can actually perform job duties. Without proper healthcare coverage, the entire fabric of our country is threatened. I&#039;ve heard and lived countless stories of getting sick while having no access to days off, having to choose between either taking a risk in losing pay for however much time, or spreading illness to coworkers, and setting off or continuing an existing chain of infections that then go on to lower productivity and a breakdown of trust between employers and a constantly rotating staff.

These votes should be postponed until such a time that ACIP is returned to its status of having highly vetted scientists with expertise in vaccines and without conflicts of interest to ensure trust in the process. 

If they proceed, nothing should be done to reduce access to these essential and lifesaving vaccines. RSV has only increased in number of cases and severity in recent years. As a pregnant person who is expecting her first child, I am deeply alarmed that access to RSV and flu shots would be curtailed. With respect to HPV, there is the potential to fully eliminate cervical cancer with consistent and widespread use of the vaccine. Vaccines are safe and effective and save lives.

I myself have gotten sick from the COVID-19  vax -- terribly so. Thank God I was already being treated in the SNiF for some other conditions, so I got rigorous treatment &amp; eventually got over it. 
I wouldn&#039;t like to see needless suffering in others. 
Thank you for your cooperation on this matter.

1. RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.

2. Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

3. ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

4. ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

5. ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

I implore you to make the right decision to keep Americans safe.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.  I have 19 years of experience in the field of public health, and a mom of young children.  I am extremely alarmed by the recent efforts by our federal government to sow doubt in vaccines and limit access to livesaving prevention.  We cannot revert our society to a time when children died from horrific infectious diseases.  That does not make us healthy or great.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some peop... [truncated]">To Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

The eradication of smallpox alone has saved millions of lives. Before the official eradication of smallpox in 1980, 3 out of 10 people infected with smallpox died. In the twentieth century, 300 million people died of smallpox. Thankfully, due to a coordinated international vaccination effort, the last naturally occuring case of smallpox happened in 1977. Smallpox was a dreadful disease that had plagued humanity for thousands of years, and it was completely eliminated in the span of two decades thanks to widely available vaccines.

To get due to cost or places that will not give the em to us. Is that the objective of this all? Upon conformation to Senator and doctor Bill Cassidy it was said vaccines would not be touched/eliminated. This seems to be a reversal.

Remove every Covid shot from the CDC&#039;s Recommended Childhood Vaccine Schedule NOW! You&#039;re a breath away from being murderers if you continue to recommend these barbaric practices. I, for one, am keenly aware that what you call a vaccine is NOT a vaccine at all, and it is NOT safe and effective. In fact, the opposite is true. The science and evidence is clear -- these stupid jabs are not only hurting children, teen, and adults, the jabs are downright killing them. 

ACIP members, please take a firm honest stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. But 38,666 deaths following COVID vaccination have been reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System as of May 30, 2025. What gives? You are insane if you continue recommending these toxic shots. All vaccines should be subject to a gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing.

( From my personal experience:
   I know very few people who have received the COVID MRNA injections that have not had some new, persisting, debilitating or life threatening conditions or multiple conditions. I know, personally, several people who died immediately after being tricked into taking the injection. My mother was one. A twenty six year old family member died from the damage and suffered for two years before dying. I have a friend RN nurse who was forced to take it or lose her job and she has gone from healthy to crippled in a few years while in her prime. ) These injections are junk science or deliberat...

As a new mother at the beginning of the pandemic, I still clearly remember the panic of my three month old having Covid and a fever so high he was floppy and hard to wake. Parents should have the choice to be vaccinated and vaccinate their children, and when these are no longer recommended and insurance will not cover the vaccine, we will put that out of reach of many families.

Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These rest...

As a public health professional, a Long Covid patient, and concerned citizen, I am appalled at the recent handling of HHS infectious disease policy, including the abrupt removal of the 17 CDC ACIP committee members that HHS Secy. Kennedy announced June 9. Their guidance for the nation has been crucial, all the more so because this is a time of increasing vaccine-preventable infectious disease challenges, including shockingly resurgent measles and pertussis, as well as the continually evolving SARS-CoV2 virus.

Four years after I had a VERY mild case of COVID -- early in 2021 before I could get vaccinated -- my stamina and activities are still significantly hindered by the effects of Long COVID. So I have tried hard to avoid getting infected again, and I regularly get updated vaccines/boosters to have some protection  against serious symptoms if I do get infected.

Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of modern science and medicine. Among many other benefits for which I am thankful, children in recent decades in the U.S have been able to survive without the disability and deaths that used to be widespread from polio, measles, rubella, and more. But now uptake rates for many vaccines are low, and in some communities they are extremely and dangerously low -- as we are seeing with the measles outbreak in west Texas.

First, I am deeply concerned about the recent removal of expert advisors from the committee. RFK Jr. must ensure that ACIP remains an independent, science-driven body free from political interference. Decisions about our national vaccination policy must be based on rigorous scientific evidence, not ideology.

I also call on ACIP members to fully disclose any and all financial or other conflicts of interest. Transparency is essential to public trust, especially when your recommendations affect the health of millions.

The committee must continue to recognize that FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective. These vaccines are not only essential for individual protection—they are vital public health tools that enable broad access through insurance coverage and help prevent outbreaks of serious diseases.

It is crucial that ACIP continue to recommend unhindered access to the full range of vaccines for people of all ages. Restricting access undermines public health and leaves vulnerable populations, including immunocompromised individuals like myself, at serious risk.

Specifically, I urge ACIP to preserve a universal recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination, including for children and pregnant people, at least twice a year. The data clearly sh...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

We need access to annual COVID vaccines please. 

Years of science and testing have shown that this a sneaky debilitating disease even for the healthiest for folks, and also that vaccines work to lower the viral load, reduce transmission from person to person, and prevent extreme symptoms and hospitalization. Doing a preventative measure like annual vaccines also reduces the financial and physical strain on hospitals and healthcare resources.

My real estate agent has long COVID since 2020 pre-vaccine and her ability to taste garlic and strawberries is completely destroyed. My parents, husband, and friends and loved ones have all had COVID with long term effects such as brain fog that lasts for months, recurring headaches, and tonsillitis. 
Without COVID vaccines, we as a human population have no chance of reduced viral load and transmission. 
Being sick often leads to missed days at work, physical disability, mental cognition impairment, and potential death of loved ones and innocent strangers. 

In the best of cases, COVID affects even the healthiest of people in a destructive, damaging way to their immune systems, and in the worst of cases, causes needless, preventable death and disability.

Vaccines are one part of mitigation in this preventable pandemic along with cleaner air, masking, sanitation and lifestyle changes, so we need ... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I am writing not on behalf of any organization but to express my own personal views. I would like to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 

Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe, effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are affected by a resurgence of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults, as well as death. 

No one should die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a grave concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

The dismissal of all 17 independent experts on June 9, 2025—replaced by appointees with documented vaccine skepticism—compromises decades of evidence-based policy. This threatens access to lifesaving vaccines for marginalized communities and undermines national health security. Below, I outline critical actions required to rectify this crisis.  

1. Vaccine Safety is Unassailable: Peer-Reviewed Evidence  
Decades of global surveillance confirm FDA-approved vaccines’ safety and efficacy:  
- COVID-19 vaccines: A CDC study of 6.2 million vaccinated individuals found no serious safety concerns, with myocarditis occurring in &lt;0.005% of recipients (mostly mild/resolved cases). Vaccination reduces COVID-19 mortality by 90% and pediatric ICU admissions by 68%.  
- Flu vaccines: Meta-analyses confirm 37–47% reduction in hospitalizations across all ages.  
- Pregnancy safety: Vaccinated pregnant individuals show no increased risk of miscarriage or preterm birth; COVID-19 vaccination cuts neonatal ICU admissions by 53%.  
This is in accordance with the evidence in many studies, specifically: NEJM (2023), JAMA Pediatrics (2024), CDC MMWR (2025) 

Dismissing this evidence endangers Americans. ACIP must restore universal recommendations for COVID-19 boosters (twice yearly)...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have a vital role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a essential role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is incredibly harmful to our public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and they should be widely available with full coverage by health insurers. The scientific evidence i... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people. I work closely with low-income families that include pregnant parents &amp; infants. These populations are vulnerable and I rely on vaccines to keep myself safe so I can continue working, and to avoid potentially exposing my clients to something that could injure them or worse. Access to vaccines is incredibly important for preserving the health and well-being or our communities and nation.

1) RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.

2) Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

3) ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

4) ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

5) ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.">As a person with a compromised immune system, it is important to me that US vaccine policy is scientifically driven and that vaccines are accessible to as many people as possible.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express serious concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines. Every hospitalization from a preventable disease means that someone else who urgently needs care is denied care.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previo...

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. 
Pediatric covid shots have no place on any vaccine schedule. We can look to other countries for this example too. Side effects are amplified in our youth- this is clear and there is no logical reason that these shots should still be legal for most children (w the possible exception of severely immunocompromised, but even that requires further study as it may be that that population is the most likely to suffer side effects given the immunosuppression these shots cause).

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I literally sobbed myself to sleep on election night when I realized that RFK Jr was going to be in charge of our nation&#039;s health.  I am terrified for the actions being taken.  This will do the OPPOSITE of encouraging confidence in our vaccination processes. I cannot fathom why you want more people to become disabled/dead.  PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD - STOP THIS INSANITY.  IF WE ARE HEALTHY WE CAN CONTINUE PUTTING MONEY IN YOUR POCKETS.  PLEASE STOP DISABLING/KILLING US.  VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE EVEN STILL GETTING THE COVID VACCINE.  WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!??!?!  

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these ... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

As someone who has personally witnessed the lifesaving impact of vaccines, I urge the CDC to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines remain widely available to everyone, regardless of age, income, or insurance status. Vaccination has been a cornerstone of public health in my life—protecting my family from preventable illnesses, allowing my elderly relatives to safely visit their grandchildren, and keeping my community’s schools and workplaces open during outbreaks. The COVID-19 vaccine, in particular, has been critical in preventing severe illness, long-term complications, and death, not just for high-risk individuals but for healthy people as well.  

Recent attempts to restrict access to COVID vaccines—whether through insurance barriers, age limitations, or unnecessary delays in approval—are deeply concerning. Science has consistently shown that these vaccines are safe and effective, and limiting their availability only undermines public health. Communities already facing healthcare disparities will suffer the most if vaccines become harder to obtain. No one should have to worry about cost or eligibility when it comes to protecting themselves and their loved ones from a preventable disease.  

I implore the CDC to uphold evidence-based policies that prioritize accessibility and equity. COVID vaccines should remain universally recommended, fully covered by insurance, and readily available to all who choose to receive them. Additionally...

Covid vaccination for my pregnant daughter saved her and her baby’s life, and now it’s not going to be covered under her insurance if she decides to have another child. This is absurd. This puts her and the baby at greater risk of dying, never mind the out of pocket costs for both vaccine and potential medical care if she gets sick. 
These are costs that wealthy people don’t have to think about, but everyone else does. 


I was told of the horrors of polio by my great uncle who nearly died from it and I witnessed first hand what whooping cough can do to an unvaccinated baby. It’s horrible. 

My whole neighborhood, a mix of Republicans and Dems, were horrified at the firing of the ACIP members. 
We, the citizens, want full transparency-no lies or misinformation. We want exactly what we have gotten from the ACIP in the past-honest, clear and EVIDENCE based recommendations that we can discuss in private with our own doctors and providers. Our tax money should go to insurance covered vaccines that saves our lives and protects the most vulnerable of our society. 
There is NO vaccine causation for autism and wasting time and money pretending there is is a smoke screen. 
Instead, my tax money has to go to research into more vaccines for any future pandemics.

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I’m writing to express absolute fury over the June 9 announcement by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., that all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have been summarily dismissed. This is not some bureaucratic reshuffling—it’s a deliberate and dangerous dismantling of one of the last bastions of independent, evidence-based public health guidance in this country. The ACIP plays a critical role in reviewing safety and efficacy data for FDA-approved vaccines, guiding insurance coverage, and ensuring access for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

RFK Jr. isn’t just blowing up ACIP—he’s blowing up vaccine access across the board, all in service of his decades-long war against science. He’s replacing expertise with conspiracy, fact with paranoia. The results are already clear: vaccination rates are falling, and we’re seeing the return of diseases we once had under control—measles, pertussis, COVID. These aren’t benign childhood illnesses. They kill people. They leave others with lifelong complications. And children are being put in harm’s way, not because vaccines don’t work, but because RFK Jr. and his allies are actively sabotaging the systems that make them available.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccination access are a prime example. Everyone—regardless of age, in... [truncated]">June 20, 2025

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express my deep concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

Please continue to make Covid-19 vaccines available at least twice a year for everyone six months and older, including pregnant women. I am very worried about being able to access vaccines for myself and my child. My two year old deserves the chance to grow u... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. 

I am writing on behalf of myself and the thousands or more of community members with Long COVID or otherwise young and healthy Americans who has suffered lasting effects from one or more COVID infections. As the CDC guidance has shifted away from masking and ventilation, SARS-CoV-2 continues to wreak havoc on our heart, immune, and neurological systems. The continued unmitigated spread of COVID has led to the rise of airborne viruses like measles and bird flu, increased chronic illnesses year-round, all of which have destroyed our livelihoods and ability to become productive members of the work force and economy. The reliance on vaccine-only interventions and absence of multi-layered approaches to airborne disease prevention is already tragically inadequate to address these ongoing public health crises, and restricting vaccine access even further would have dire consequences for children and every subset of US working populations, including future labor forces.

I am also writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of th...

Kennedy, Jr. 
Independent expert scientific and medical input from ACIP is crucial to informing access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines to protect the nation against severe and potentially deadly infectious diseases, as well as to guide insurance coverage and provide  vaccines to uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination coverage rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID-19, which can result in serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not (but will) die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. The people of this country need strong support for safe and effective vaccines against measles, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), COVID-19, human papilloma virus (HPV), influenza, meningococcal disease, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. 
Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.
Dr Stephenie Senior write an excellent paper on the pitfalls, unknowns and harms of using  LNP ‘s . I never caught  Covid and never took the “ jab” nor will I ever submit. I worked  in the hospital lab through that entire siege never became ill either anything. Please Robert Kennedy take this monstrosity off the vaccine list.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines! That must be what we concern ourselves with here!

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such appalling barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only ...

As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important tools for addressing SARS-CoV-2. Universal access to updated COVID vaccines is needed to address the ongoing variants. Additionally, vaccines must be recommended for individuals of all ages and be fully covered by public funds/or insurance at a regular interval of at least every six months.

The vaccine schedule should address waning efficacy in the months following vaccination [1-3] as well as the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains. FDA decisions will affect the current and future vaccine approach, including what healthcare providers recommend, what health insurance covers, and the level of public engagement.

Restricting access to these vaccinations, at any level, neglects the responsibility to protect everyone, as anyone is vulnerable to a COVID infection that could lead to severe health outcomes or Long COVID. Given that there is the potential to update the vaccines to better match perpetually emerging variants, updates to all vaccine types are needed, and ensuring access to all options made by all three manufacturers is very important.

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Hello,

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

As a mother to a young child and the daughter of a parent who is 65+, it is dire that we have access to current and updated vaccines to protect ourselves and our community. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

History has shown us that vaccines are safe, effective and have saved millions of lives that otherwise would have been needlessly lost to illness.  We must not go back!

Recent experience with the covid pandemic also demonstrates the continued necessity of keeping the covid vaccine EASILY accessible to EVERYONE: children, pregnant people, seniors and everyone else.  More than 3/4 of the US population falls into one or more risk categories, and we know for a fact that even a so-called &quot;mild&quot; case causes lifelong issues.  We should not be taking steps to ridiculously codify the continuation of a mass-disabling event.  Is the covid vaccine perfect?  No.  No vaccine is.  But the percentage of people harmed by vaccines is far, far, far, far smaller than the percentage of people harmed by catching covid (and all of the other vaccine-preventable illnesses.)  There should be no home for eugenics in US vaccination policy!

My husband was permanently harmed by covid.  Our dreams for how we were going to spend our senior years were completed destroyed by the lingering after-effects of long covid.  I do not wish this nightmare upon another soul - and certainly not when it can and should be prevented.

I urge ACIP members to update themselves of the latest published science around vaccines in general, and the covid &quot;vaccine&quot; in particular. The evidence is incontrovertible, and will lead to the only justifiable conclusion, to immediately remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately cancelled after 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. This position is not sustainable, and raises serious questions of the underlying motives of this committee and other government bodies. At some point continued use of these disastrous gene therapies crosses the line from benign neglect to wilful harm for nefarious motives, from which prosecution must surely follow. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies before licensing .

If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing and releasing to the public. 

More and more information is coming out on deaths caused by the COVID vaccines — Myocarditis related issues specifically. I urge you to  do the right thing and ban these vaccinations. It is criminal that these were let through and promoted by our public agencies and politicians when they are dangerous. How could this be allowed to happen?

As a cervical cancer survivor and a passionate public health advocate, I submit this comment in strong support of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&#039; continued efforts to evaluate and recommend life-saving vaccines, including those for HPV, COVID-19, influenza, RSV, and more.

Before my diagnosis, I wasn’t aware that a vaccine existed that could have prevented the cancer that changed my life. That experience taught me that prevention matters and that access to accurate information and timely vaccination can be life-saving. Thanks to scientific progress and effective public health initiatives, we now have tools that offer protection where none existed.

Vaccines remain one of the most outstanding achievements in public health. They help protect individuals and families across all age groups, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and contribute to stronger, healthier communities.

As the committee continues its important work, I respectfully encourage the continued prioritization of:

Science-based decision-making

Transparent, consistent public education about recommended vaccines

Efforts to strengthen vaccine confidence and understanding across all communities

Members of the FDA VRBPAC:

The FDA must ensure a four-week public comment period before an upcoming committee meeting. One week prior is not enough time for—and effectively preventing—public feedback.

As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence clearly indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important tools for addressing SARS-CoV-2. Universal access to updated COVID vaccines is needed to address the ongoing changes in variants. Additionally, vaccines must be recommended for individuals of all ages and be fully covered by public funds/or insurance at a regular interval of at least every six months.

The vaccine schedule should address waning efficacy in the months following vaccination [1-3] as well as the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains. FDA decisions will affect the current and future vaccine approach, including what healthcare providers recommend, what health insurance covers, and level of public engagement.

Restricting access to these vaccinations, at any level, neglects the responsibility to protect everyone, as anyone is vulnerable to a COVID infection that could lead to severe health outcomes or Long COVID. Given that there is the potential to update the vaccines to better match perpetually emerging variants, updates to all vaccine types are needed, and ensuring access to all options made by all three manufacturers is very important. In addition, the FDA must continue to ... [truncated]">Docket No. FDA-2025-N-1146

My name is Julie and I am a new mother concerned about the availability of vaccines. I am submitting comment here in favor of keeping Covid vaccines available to the general public, including children and pregnant women, because they have been proven scientifically to protect the lives of the general population and those at heightened risk. It is blatantly un-American to remove the choice for our citizens to get these vaccines. The FDA has approved these for all ages. There is no precedent for removing availability of a vaccine from market that has been approved by the FDA to be safe and effective. If parents or citizens do not wish to get the vaccine that is their choice. However, we should not remove the choice for other members of society to get this vaccine. For me, I do not wish my infant to be exposed without any protection and risk hospitalization. Additionally, my husband and I are both high risk individuals. Myself being asthmatic and him being immunocompromised. These vaccines need to be available for children to protect vulnerable adults as well, as my daughter is a potential threat vector for our health as well. It is for this reason, I am writing to support availability of Covid vaccines and ask for the government remain consistent in terms of FDA approvals. We should not be in the business of meddling in citizens health decisions when the medical intervention has already been approved and shown to be safe.">Hello,

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

The vaccine schedule we have now is effective and safe. I am a resident of TX, where currently 750 people have contracted measles this year as part of this recent outbreak. Two unvaccinated children have died. MMR vaccination has undoubtedly helped prevent the infection of many who have been exposed, given how contagious measles is.

RFK Jr is making the CDC and the ACIP follow his agenda of anti-science with his repeated untrue statements about vaccines. 
In my 32 years as a practicing pediatrician I have seen the incredible health benefits of vaccines for my patients.  Early in my career, I treated children with measles who needed ICU admissions for respiratory failure, whooping cough causing young infants to stop breathing every time they coughed, children who suffered brain abscesses and sepsis from Haemophilus Influenzae B. During the covid epidemic, the mother of one of my patients, who was an otherwise healthy adult, needed to be put on a ventilator for respiratory failure due to Covid 19 after giving birth to her newborn because at the time we did not have a covid vaccine to protect her. Another patient of mine lost her mother due to Covid 19 infection. Today I  do not see the critically dangerous effects of vaccine preventable infections because of continually improved vaccine efficacy and widespread vaccine use.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I want to start by saying that access to the COVID-19 vaccine has personally allowed me to recover from COVID-19 with no long term symptoms and manageable interim symptoms. Vaccines and continuous access to booster vaccines to the general public is crucial to the health of countless people. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and ...

This disease is clearly continuing to kill, which is a sad commentary on our society that we are so selfish that most people refuse to mask and continue to go into public places when they are obviously ill and contagious. 

Another important issue that most metrics fail to consider is the morbidity &amp; loss of productivity associated with PASC (post acute sequela of COVID-19), also known as “Long Covid.” &quot;On average, among those with long COVID symptoms, the amount of time loss was nearly 100 hours (equivalent to 2.7 weeks of full-time work) more over 3 months &amp; almost 15% greater work performance impairment per week,&quot; the authors concluded. They added that the productivity loss described in the study is comparable to the burden associated with chronic migraine, multiple sclerosis, &amp; rheumatoid arthritis. ( https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/long-covid-tied-substantial-loss-work-productivity)

I am the mother of a vaccine injured child- Injured by a flu shot.  There are no studies comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated children, and no studies that actually compare apples to apples period.  What I’ve learned since my child’s injury is absolutely shocking.  As a highly educated attorney I believed that these products were properly safety tested.  After a deep dive into the work of fellow attorneys doing this litigation I’ve discovered that these products ARE NOT properly safety tested.  My child is a victim of this corrupt system.  Please test these products, find out why so many kids are at risk of injury.  Who is at risk and thus should NOT get vaccinated?  Will my future grandchild also be at risk?  We need studies done and hopefully safer vaccines created.  The current products are insufficiently safety tested and instead pushed blindly on everyone- in many cases even on those who have already been injured.  This is corruption beyond compare and our children deserve better.">I am writing in support of this new committee in an attempt to clean up our current corrupted vaccination system that is controlled by big pharma and profits.

CDC ACIP should represent the gold standard in evidence-based, apolitical recommendations. Instead, the HHS secretary has done exactly what he promised not to do during confirmation: purge career experts in favor of unqualified individuals who seek to gain personal advancement and power by seeding doubt and confusion about proven vaccine science. This will kill people. This will make people sick, especially children, as we have already seen with recent outbreaks. The chilling effect on vaccine uptake is already hurting people; this group must represent a bulwark against vaccine backsliding so that we can follow real science as led by actual experts. Diseases live in the objective, evidence-based world, and they will not stop because of a political shift.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

 Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. 
Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

	1.	Expand the Novavax BLA by removing the requirement that it only be used for individuals with underlying conditions. COVID-19 vaccines should be universally accessible, and Novavax offers a critical option for those seeking a protein-based platform.
	2.	Authorize strain targeting for JN.1, consistent with WHO recommendations. Novavax’s saponin-based adjuvant has demonstrated protection against circulating subvariants and should be allowed to stay current.
	3.	Adjust the timing of strain selection earlier in the year to align with the school calendar. This will help ensure vaccine availability by the end of summer, enabling better protection for students and staff at the start of the academic year.
	4.	Support expedited approval for children and broaden Novavax’s access across all age groups. A non-mRNA option is important for many families and could help improve pediatric vaccination rates.
	5.	Permit a new primary series with Novavax for anyone, including those who have not yet started vaccination or are seeking to restart with a non-mRNA platform.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

From AP News, “The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses. She has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation. Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He’s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.”

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am writing to express concerns about the future access of vaccines for the general public, as well as the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 

Vaccines are beneficial to public health and serve to prevent death, hospitalization, and disability from infectious diseases. My family and I have benefited from being able to receive vaccines and stay healthy in this age of modern science. 

Limiting access to vaccines is serious and can have long-lasting negative impacts on the U.S. public. I am concerned about the unmitigated spread of diseases such as measles and COVID-19 due to increased restrictions that will limit those who can get the vaccine and increase the risk of disease spread for everyone. This will weaken immune systems, cause more disability, and increase completely preventable infections and deaths. 

I want to ask that the ACIP:

1.  Continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US, including vaccines for HPV, COVID-19, and the flu.
2. Preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.
3. Ensure that all vaccine policy decisions continue to be considered, evaluated, and concluded using open and transparent processes with opportunitie... [truncated]">To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

There is ample evidence for and research on the prevalence of long-term effects of COVID-19 infection and its ability to affect quality of life. Persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, memory problems, and cognitive impairment are all recorded effects of Long COVID.

Everyone deserves the right to protect themselves, their family, and their community from preventable disability. Evidence is clear that vaccinations are effective both at preventing COVID infection and at preventing serious long-term effects of infection. I urge the committee to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations for all people above 6 months of age, at least annually.

The rising numbers of preventable disease, such as Measles cases in now 35 states, demonstrates an alarming distrust in science and public health that is already causing suffering and death. It is the responsibility of the ACIP committee to stand firm in their support of research-based disease prevention methods, and not to sow unnecessary doubt among the public. I urge the committee to support widespread access to FDA-approved vaccines.

Thank you.">I am writing to the ACIP committee with concern about access to COVID-19 immunizations.

Having nearly lost my brother to the first wave of COVID, I went to great lengths (including driving long distances) to obtain my first COVID vaccination.  Since I work in a public facing field and regularly come into prolonged contact with people from all over the country, I am deeply grateful to the scientists and biomedical companies that produced the vaccine and the infrastructure that made it available.  I am also old enough to remember (and to have personally witnessed!) the profound damage caused by polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and whooping cough, and to be thankful that vaccination would protect my children from infection-caused blindness, hearing loss, sterility, heart damage, or miscarriage. 

ACIP must:
* preserve an independent decision process, with genuine experts as advisors.
* require its members to disclose all conflicts of interest
* understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines have already been tested and found to be safe and effective.
* recommend easy access to a wide range of vaccines, since such recommendations permit insurance coverage
* preserve universal recommendation for COVID vaccination for people of all ages, especially including children and pregnant women.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market.

Public Comment on ACIP Nominations

 I rely on science-based medicine and vaccine guidance to stay alive and well. I’ve watched with deep concern as disinformation has spread in recent years, threatening not just public health, but the very trust that allows communities to care for one another. That’s why I strongly oppose the nomination of Vicky Pebsworth, Martin Kulldorff, Retsef Levi, and Robert Malone to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

These individuals have publicly undermined the scientific consensus on vaccines, promoted conspiracy theories, and in some cases, admitted to lacking direct vaccine expertise—despite that being a clear requirement for ACIP service. For example:
    •    Retsef Levi has acknowledged his limited experience with vaccines, yet has made unsupported claims that mRNA vaccines cause death.
    •    Martin Kulldorff refused COVID-19 vaccination while in a public teaching role and promoted strategies that contradicted ethical public health principles during a deadly pandemic.
    •    Robert Malone has spread misleading claims suggesting that mRNA vaccines worsen infection outcomes.
    •    Vicky Pebsworth serves on the board of an organization known for spre...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously h...

RE: Docket Number CDC-2025-0024-0001 (Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices)
 
To Whom It May Concern:

I have concerns about the recent activities related to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the agenda of this meeting. 
I feel that the replacement of the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices less than two weeks before this meeting removes continuity and creates uncertainty in the ability of the committee to accomplish its expressed agenda at this public meeting.

The docket specifies “Matters To Be Considered: The agenda will include discussions on anthrax vaccines, chikungunya vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, influenza vaccines, Lyme disease vaccine, meningococcal vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccines for adults, and RSV vaccines for maternal and pediatric populations. Recommendation votes are scheduled for COVID-19 vaccines, HPV vaccine, influenza vaccines, meningococcal vaccine, RSV vaccines for adults, and RSV vaccine for maternal and pediatric populations. Vaccines for Children (VFC) votes are scheduled for COVID-19 vaccines, HPV vaccine, influenza vaccines, and RSV v... [truncated]">Friday June 20, 2025

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

My parter is immune compromised.  She works so hard every day to be OK and be present and available to our toddler.  Long COVID would devastate our family.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone m... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

My parter is immune compromised.  She works so hard every day to be OK and be present and available to our toddler.  Long COVID would devastate our family.

I&#039;m writing to express my concerns over recent announcements and changes with the CDC&#039;s ACIP. My main concerns center around the dignity of all people, the need for all people to contribute to and support the common good, the importance public health advocacy, and the longstanding, effective and widespread vaccination as part of effective public health policy. 

To support the common good of all lucky enough to call the United States home, I wish to express the importance of the following:
    
• RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.

• Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

 • ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

 • ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

• ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. 

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. 

Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available ... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccination. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only s...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I live with family who are and I am immunocompromised myself. Furthermore, I know indiscriminate access to vaccines can and should be a standard of American life. Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Ever... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Also, it needs to be a part of your job to make sure a shot is not called a vaccine, when it does not do what a vaccine is supposed to do, which is prevent spread and protect from getting the disease.  To call an untested bioweapon a shot is criminal in my book.  This is what happened with the Covid shot and it fooled a lot of people into thinking it was a real vaccine.

I have no financial conflicts of interest to speak of.

I&#039;m writing to you today to say that you must ensure that vaccine access to the general population remains unhindered. To maintain a healthy population (of body &amp; mind), both elderly and young people should have the option to get vaccinated for covid-19 to protect themselves from the dire threats disease poses to one&#039;s nervous system, long-term brain function, and overall health. Having access to the covid-19 vaccine will greatly benefit *everyone*, irrespective of age. It is illogical and unscientific to suggest otherwise. Allowing RFK Jr to revoke access to vaccines from younger people only serves to increase the spread of covid-19 and thus long covid. A population constantly reinfecting itself poses an omnipresent threat to the elderly and/or immunocompromised, the people RFKJr claims he has in his best interest . 

Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. We ask you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all CO...

As sang by U2, “where you live should not decide whether you live or you die.” The inequalities in health in the United States are already widespread with health outcomes and access to healthcare  closely linked to a person’s neighborhood. This was widely shown during the COVID-19 pandemic where some people in the US had much lower rates of vacation and much higher rates of hospitalization and death. With the recent changes to the ACIP members, there is even greater risk now that many more people will lose access to vaccinations and will suffer serious consequences and die as a result. In fact, I am now worried that just by living in the United States, we will be at greater risk of dying from vaccine-preventable diseases. My sister unknowingly drank a smoothie that was contaminated with Hepatitis A as part of a huge nationwide outbreak - it was her daughter’s smoothie. Her daughter had been vaccinated for Hepatitis A based on recent recommendations; my sister had not because it wasn’t recommended for her age unless traveling.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. 

Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

As a person at-risk from COVID-19 for a number of generally recognized reasons, I am very worried about the recent termination of ALL 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee, as was announced June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These members have had a crucial role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee, providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines, while simultaneously guiding insurance coverage, and coverage for uninsured children (through the Vaccines for Children program). Right now, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are frighteningly low, and communities all across the U.S. are already affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like: measles and pertussis. Despite the scoffing of many members of the general public with either short memories or no pre-vaccine experience with these diseases, these infections can cause serious and sometimes *lifelong* consequences on their health. In 2025, it is ridiculous that children would die, or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations, against the interest of public health. ESPECIA... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

We know that vaccines lower the risk of getting severe disease or death. They also help reduce transmission and lower the risk of developing long term issues from viruses. We need affordable or free access for everyone who wants them to protect themselves and people like me.

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express my deep concerns for the future of the health of my loved ones and everyone who resides in the United States. Vaccines are a fundamental pillar to the health of not only individuals, but also for communities across our country. There are dangerous falsehoods being spread about vaccines, which are scientifically proven and historically successful in protecting us from the most harmful impacts of viral diseases. Concerning decisions are being made about forthcoming vaccines, including for COVID-19, and I have grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong co... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Merck Manual 1980’s Viruses: The smallest of Parasites 

Not just SarsCov2 spike protein acts as a parasite but the CIA declassified a paper that indicated Cancer is similar to Parasites and that paper was classified as secret by the CIA . 


Hence the antiparasitics may also have   antiviral properties and allow development of NK and tcell immunity similar to an effective  vaccine.

Please Discuss Nitazoxanide as a broad spectrum antiviral as well as antiparasitic that may be safer than placebo and cost less than $2 for 6 pills in other countries but be priced at over $1200 in the USA making use of such a beneficial antiviral prohibitively expensive. 





ACTION ITEMS: 
•  1) Please do not mandate or financially incentivize Pediatricians or any physicians to vaccinate with any inoculation that contains “secret” or proprietary ingredients, adjuvants or contaminants. The ACIP should work toward transparency of ingredients in any mandated or suggested vaccine. Radical Transparency as promised.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am an elderly citizen, with diabetes and a heart condition, and I need ALL adults to have access to the Covid vaccine and other vaccines to mitigate the very real risks I face when leaving my home, undergoing medical treatment or seeing my grandchildren.Therefore, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Thank you for being willing to serve in this very important advisory committee. Please ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies, before licensing. Those in leadership must be aware of the responsibility for the lives which are impacted by potentially toxic ingredients in vaccines leading to the current unhealthy trends in our children due to current school/work policies based around the Childhood Vaccine Schedule.  The Childhood Schedule is a mechanism for those who want to keep their monetary cycle going (researchers, pharma companies, insurance companies/Medicare, and administrators of medical providers) at the expense of little children and their families&#039; well-being, and are fully aware that true informed consent re vaccines is never understood nor given.  Most of the vaccines currently on the schedule are not needed as the diseases are no longer present nor do they cause death or permanent disability, whereas the toxic ingredients in vaccines actually do. Specifically the following need to be taken off or never put on the Childhood Schedule: Covid (take off the market please) RSV, HPV and flu.    This nation is governed by the people therefore we only can pray for you and make our voices heard. I speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.

Decades of science demonstrate the safety of vaccines, reinforcing that they offer many health benefits and have few side effects. Vaccines are among the most rigorously tested and monitored medical breakthroughs in history. The risk of serious side effects from vaccination is extremely low; in contrast, many vaccine-preventable diseases carry far greater risks of illness or death.

Purging the ACIP of members who have served to make recommendations to reduce risk of infectious disease complications is a move by HHS that will reduce healthcare workers&#039; confidence in HHS. I urge Secretary Kennedy to reinstate the ACIP as it was constituted two weeks ago. The committee as it stands today lacks the qualifications to make trusted recommendations on vaccination. Putting thimerosal in multi-dose influenza vaccines on today&#039;s meeting agenda in only bit of evidence that the committee is abandoning evidence-based practices. Removing multi-dose vials from the influenza vaccine supply will increase cost of vaccination, meaning that even fewer Americans will be protected against influenza - which kills thirty-six thousand of us. This past year, over 200 American children perished from flu. Ninety percent of those kids weren&#039;t fully vaccinated.

HHS should stop taking actions to make America less healthy.">I'm a board-certified pediatrician with over 25 years of experience caring for well and sick children.

Recently it was time for my child and I to get our annual Covid booster for Covid 19. I had to really push to be able to get the vaccine for my child and this is while the vaccine is still available for her age group. I was deeply frustrated and upset that I ran into such trouble. 

I am urging the ACIP to leave widespread non-contingent access to vaccines. It is important for my insurance to pay for the vaccines and for me to be able to make the choice to vaccinate my family. 

I also urge that RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.  As a PhD Mathematician I am appalled that we would replace experts in this manner. 

I also want to keep the rules that members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest. 

I want the ACIP to preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.


Thank you for your considerations to continue to have experts making sound evidence based decisions about vaccines.
