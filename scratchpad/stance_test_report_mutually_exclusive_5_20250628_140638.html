This will discourage qualified people from working in the federal government when we need them the most, particularly in the areas of veterans affairs, medicine, and scientific research. These jobs need to be filled by qualified people who can freely express their professional findings without fear of retribution.

[Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004]

RIN 3206-AO80

The proposed rule claims that employees in this category will not have to “personally or politically support the president.” However, that assertion seems dubious—at best. There are plenty of recent examples of government employees being reprimanded for not showing &quot;proper&#x27; loyalty to Trump&#x27;s agenda. Trump has shown little tolerance for any hint of political disloyalty, hesitation about policy agendas, or questioning of legality of administration actions. 

If, as the new “Schedule Policy/Career” classification allows, wide swaths of the federal workforce could be fired at will—without any process—it would not be hard for the administration to target and terminate people based on political views and just claim whatever justification they choose for doing so.

This could lead to greater federal workforce turnover, with changes in presidential administrations ushering in new cadres of policy-influencing employees, causing increased instability in agencies’ interpretations and implementations of laws.

Also, a decline in the institutional history and technical expertise career civil servants develop and bring to bear in formulating policy.

There would be less accountability to Congress regarding the laws that agencies administer, and more opportunities for political favoritism in federal contracting.

A civil servant with career protections has incentive to refuse unethical activity and to adhere to constitutional requirements, as losing a long-term safe employment is usually not worth a quick buck.

Further, while the proposed rule claims that these positions will be &quot;non partisan&quot; and &quot;non political&quot;, that is demonstrably false. Even if that were to be pursued in good faith initially, the temptation to dismiss now at-will employees for political reasons will be acted upon, as history has always shown. I think it is wise for anyone seriously considering this proposal to do some research into why the civil service system limiting political positions and protecting other positions exists; it&#x27;s not a pretty story.

I am under no illusions that this comment will be read, internalized, or responded to in good faith. Those who wrote this don&#x27;t want a better civil service; they want more positions they can stuff underqualified political drones into so they can reward political supporters free of senate approval...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually.

In particular, the Schedule F Executive Order represents the greatest threat to the system of merit embedded in the American civil service system since its inception. There simply is no body of evidence that suggests that allowing partisans to fire career officials in highly politicized settings improves performance. Indeed, what evidence we have suggests the opposite. As a scientist, I think the possibility of making NIH directors, program officers, and other staff (e.g., SRO, GMS) political appointees is antithetical to scientific progress and effective government. Either party should be *very wary* of what this type of action could do to the essential work of the government. Think about a President of the opposite party that you prefer having the ability to infect partisanship into every type of government decision.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are free of corruption and not biased towards any political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They should never be political appointees—they should be skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically-aligned individuals based on an administration&#x27;s agenda would erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal would open the door to introducing widespread corruption in federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

I have worked as a scientist in both academia and industry. These two realms of science are mutually beneficial.  Industry uses the basic science discoveries that are deemed ‘too risky’ for industry to try.

Until very recently, scientists from around the world were eager to come to the United States to study and do research at our academic institutions. Many stayed here and started successful companies, employing thousands of U.S. citizens and generating two to 20-fold returns for every federal dollar spent.  

How many stocks have this kind of return on investment while also benefitting humanity with cures for diseases, help for farmers, and other technological advances?  

Science is a long-term investment, however, that benefits greatly from highly skilled grant evaluators, not this year’s crop of political appointees.  

Please do not reinstate Schedule F.

If civil service is increasingly subject to the pleasure (read: whims) of whomever is in office, then civil service will have too much turnover to be effective.

Further, servants will perform their jobs based on who is in charge, rather than serving the public or their various fields of expertise.  Not only is this a conflict of interest (loyalty to the public or one&#x27;s craft vs. loyalty to whatever administration is in charge), it could have a chilling effect on these servants&#x27; freedom to perform their jobs.

Last, a rule like this one– which proposes significant turnover of a large number of government jobs– well necessarily result in a large number of lawsuits for the employees who are involved.  This will clog the courts and waste national resources on legal fees, and potentially, paying out claims.  There are more efficient ways to be efficient.">The rule should not be adopted.

OPM’s explicit intent to make federal employees easier to fire by reclassifying career civil servants to at-will employees not only violates basic notions of fairness, it subverts Congressional intent to create a narrow category for excepted service, which is so-called precisely because Congress meant these political positions to be an exception to the norm—the norm being merit-based, competitive positions. Merit-based protections mattered to Congress in the 1970s when it wrote the Civil Service Reform Act for the same reasons it matters to us federal workers today. They wanted us to be free to do our jobs of providing vital public services without fear or favor. The statute was legislators’ attempt to clean up the cronyism of the spoils system and OPM, with this rule, seeks to catapult us back into the mire of partisanship.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

Comment in Opposition to OPM-2025-0004 (RIN 3206-AO80)
To Whom It May Concern,
I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a federal employee at a financial regulatory agency with over 12 years of experience managing large-scale federal data and analytics programs. I strongly oppose the proposed “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” rule (RIN 3206-AO80). This rule would fundamentally undermine the integrity, independence, and effectiveness of the career civil service.
I have led the planning and implementation of critical government systems, including analytics infrastructure that supports millions of data points and enables real-time insights for thousands of government users. I have also developed acquisition strategies, managed cross-functional teams, and helped modernize agency tools that directly serve the public. This work depends on the stability, expertise, and protection afforded by civil service rules that insulate career staff from political interference.
Stripping policy-influencing positions of due process protections—as this rule proposes—would not improve performance. It would inject political instability into roles that require deep technical skill, institutional knowledge, and impartial judgment. At-will employment would disincentivize honest analysis, suppress scientific integrity, and risk the loss of specialized staff who already forgo higher pr... [truncated]">Agency name: OPM

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.
Introducing political instability through Schedule F would:

              title="Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed federal civil service rule changes affecting career employees in policy-influencing positions. I am deeply concerned about the proposed reclassification of approximately 50,000 federal positions to “Schedule Policy/Career,” making them at-will and subject to dismissal without the established procedural protections.
The proposed rule appears to undermine the merit-based principles enshrined in the Pendleton Act and subsequent civil service reforms, which were specifically designed to insulate federal employment from political influence and patronage.
The claim that these positions will continue to be filled through “nonpartisan, merit-based hiring processes” seems inconsistent with the removal of due process protections and the explicit aim to allow swift dismissal for “undermining Presidential directives,” which could be interpreted as requiring political loyalty over professional expertise and ethical standards.
The initiative risks eroding the institutional knowledge, continuity, and nonpartisan expertise that are essential for effective policy implementation, especially in critical areas like mental health, where stability and professional judgment are paramount.
This rule change should not take effect. Converting nonpartisan government positions to political appointments is a recipe for corruption, instability, inefficiency, and incompetence.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

German science was the world standard before the Nazis took over and implemented political oversight, banned certain types of work, encouraged pseudoscience, and fired “undesirable” scientists and professors. As a footnote to the destruction wreaked by the Nazi regime, German science still hasn’t fully recovered, over 90 years hence.

Stalin in the USSR also politicized science, becoming enamored with a pseudoscience advocate by the name of Lysenko, who rejected the very concept of genetics, and believed that crops could basically be &quot;re-educated.&quot; Politicization of science not only lead to the imprisonment and murder of biologists who called out Lysenko&#x27;s bad science, it also led to the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens from famine.

Our HHS Secretary, RFK, Jr, is an antivaccination advocate and flirts with ideas that could best be described as eugenics. His agency has wontonly cut massive amounts of medical research that had already been funded and was in progress. He has proclaimed that infectious disease research should be halted for 8 years, claiming that infectious diseases are not a threat to “healthy people” – an idea that I, as a physician, can tell you is patently false.

    2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [Docket No. OPM–2025–0004]

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the reclassifying of specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans and informs critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could lead to the politicization of the federal statistical workforce. Official federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. A President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career. Then, for example, Bureau of Labor Statistics’ leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the President’s policy agenda. They might also face pressure... [truncated]">5/7/2025

The federal government has long protected federal workers from political pressures and should continue to do so. Science and in fact medicine and all other civil servants should be protected from political pressures. 

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Trump administration&#x27;s recent actions aimed at dismantling federal worker protections. The proposed regulations, which would reclassify thousands of career civil servants as &quot;at-will&quot; employees, undermine the principles of merit-based employment and civil service independence that are foundational to our democratic institutions. 

These changes are part of a broader strategy to politicize the federal workforce, making it easier to remove employees who may disagree with the administration&#x27;s policies. Such moves not only threaten the job security of dedicated public servants but also compromise the integrity and effectiveness of federal agencies. 

I urge you to stand against these efforts and support measures that protect the rights and independence of federal workers. Ensuring a fair and impartial civil service is essential for maintaining public trust and upholding the rule of law.">I am highly opposed to this change.

I am especially concerned about the provisions related to the reclassification of certain federal positions into a new category, Schedule Policy/Career. These provisions raise significant concerns regarding the politicization of the federal workforce, the erosion of accountability, and the degradation of quality within the civil service.

The definitions provided in the proposed rule for &quot;policy-making,&quot; &quot;policy-determining,&quot; and &quot;policy-advocating&quot; positions are overly broad and lack the precision necessary to ensure consistent and fair implementation. By failing to establish clear, objective criteria for what constitutes a policy-related role, the rule enables the reclassification of career positions that traditionally and appropriately fall under the merit-based civil service system. Employees whose responsibilities involve implementing, advising on, or interpreting policies—not creating them—could be stripped of competitive hiring protections and due process rights.  I am especially concerned about federal employees with scientific roles that are likely to be considerably affected.  The proposed rule is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists and scientific evidence, which depends on open dialogue, different perspectives, and reexamination.

The NIH is the world&#x27;s leader in biomedical research funding BECAUSE its funding decisions are made by independent teams of experienced experts (all of them working scientists themselves) which is the best way of ensuring, as far as possible, that the most promising research gets funded. These grant evaluations and funding decisions are made INDEPENDENTLY from political or ideological considerations - that is why they are so vital, and the integrity and validity of this process is literally the envy of the scientific world.

By creating a new Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service and exempting those employees from the adverse action procedures and appeals protections under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, this proposal fundamentally undermines the nonpartisan merit-based civil service established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).

The CSRA was enacted to ensure that employees are “protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes” and to uphold an effective and efficient merit-based civil service (5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)). This proposed rule reverses those principles by designating certain career positions as effectively at-will, subject to removal without meaningful procedural safeguards. This would significantly weaken civil service protections that have been in place for decades, diminishing the neutrality and continuity of our federal workforce.

Additionally, by shifting a broad class of career positions into an at-will category that can be easily reshaped by each incoming administration, this rule risks triggering cyclical, large-scale turnover every four to eight years. Such turnover would deplete institutional knowledge and discourage long-term public service careers. It would also erode the impartiality that is essential to maintaining public trust in the implementation of laws and policies.

RIN 3206-AO80

I strongly oppose the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule to reclassify certain civil service positions—including those within the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—into Schedule Policy/Career, thereby stripping these positions of critical due process protections and making them at-will roles.

This rule threatens to inject dangerous levels of politicization into federal agencies that must remain impartial and rooted in science, evidence, and the public good. Nowhere is this more consequential than at the NIH, where the integrity of our nation’s biomedical research enterprise depends on the stability, independence, and expertise of its leadership and scientific staff.

First, by increasing the turnover of key leadership positions, this rule would undermine the long-term planning and sustained execution that biomedical research requires. Science does not operate on political timelines; it demands continuity, objectivity, and insulation from partisan shifts.

Second, it appears the proposed changes could result in all NIH Institute and Center Directors—along with most or all Division Directors—becoming political appointees. Currently, only the NIH Director and the NCI Director are presidential appointments. Expanding this to virtually all senior NIH leadership threatens to erode the apolitical foundation on which the NIH has bee... [truncated]">In response to:

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees&#x27; constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a professional, independent civil service. Specific concerns are presented below.
 
· Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of “policy-influencing” roles to make it easier to purge career staff. It&#x27;s the latest attempt from this Administration to replace professionalism with ideological alignment.
 
· Massive Expansion of At-Will Employment: The proposed rule would dramatically expand the number of civil servants who serve at the pleasure of the President from approximately 4,000 political appointees to potentially hundreds of thousands of what had been career employees.
 
· Ideologically Driven Rulemaking: OPM makes sweeping claims about political “resistance” in the civil service based on cherry-picked anecdotes and selective surveys, using these to justify maximalist removal authority.

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.
Introducing political instability through Schedule F would:
