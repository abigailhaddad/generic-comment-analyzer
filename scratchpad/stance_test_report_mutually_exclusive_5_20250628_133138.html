In reality, it would inject raw partisanship into the day-to-day workings of government, triggering whiplash-inducing swings in federal policy and leadership every time the presidency changes hands. This approach contradicts both the merit-based principles of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the founding ideas of a politically neutral bureaucracy laid out by Woodrow Wilson.

In his 1887 essay “The Study of Administration,” Woodrow Wilson called for a professional civil service, separate from partisan politics. He argued that government must be run by trained administrators—public servants guided by expertise and law, not the changing tides of political loyalty. This vision was a response to the patronage-heavy &quot;spoils system&quot; of the 19th century, where winning elections meant the wholesale replacement of civil servants with political supporters. The result was a government that lurched from one extreme to the next, with little continuity, institutional memory, or competence. Schedule F threatens to bring us back to that model. It would give any administration the power to purge and replace career federal employees en masse based on vague criteria like &quot;policy-related positions.&quot; What starts as an effort to remove opposition could quickly become a means to install partisan lo...

Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

    2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

    3.

	The premises of the proposed rule are faulty.  The US government already has a large number of at-will, politically accountable, policy making appointments in Schedule C.  The sizeable number of Schedule C positions already assures the political accountability that this rule purports to enhance.  Moreover, the Civil Service Reform Act explicitly addressed issues of civil service performance and accountability through major provisions such as creation of the Senior Executive Service and the Merit System Protection Board.  Had Congress intended to restructure the civil service by dramatically increasing the at will status of “policy influencing” employees, it surely would have done so explicitly.  It did not.  
	Indeed, the proposed rule’s use of the vague and expansive term “policy-influencing positions”-- in place of the statute’s far more precise and limiting language of positions of a “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character”—signals the true intent of the proposed rule, which is to politicize the federal bu...

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Civil service employees need protections in place to protect them when agency policy is detrimental to veterans, the American public, and basic civil rights. The notion that it is difficult to terminate civil employees under the current system is absurd. I have witnessed various high ranking civil service employees being terminated from their positions based on improper conduct.
When I was in the military, my flight commander always encouraged us to speak up when given an unethical order. Likewise, my training officer in officer training school stated that no good leader likes yes men. A good leader isn’t afraid of employees disagreeing with or bringing new information to their attention in order to better policies and procedures.

Subject: Comment on Proposed Rule – Opposition to Schedule F (Docket No. OPM-2025-0004)

To Whom It May Concern:

I am submitting this comment in response to the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule, Docket No. OPM-2025-0004, published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025. I am a federal civilian employee working in contracting and acquisition for a major Department of Defense agency, and I strongly oppose any attempt to reinstate or expand the Schedule F excepted service category.

Reintroducing Schedule F is like putting lipstick on a pig. No amount of rebranding—“modernization,” “efficiency,” or “accountability”—can hide the fact that this proposal is an effort to erode the core merit principles of the civil service. Schedule F would give political appointees broad authority to reclassify and remove career employees without due process, threatening the stability, neutrality, and institutional expertise that are vital to good governance.

In acquisition and contracting, continuity and legal compliance are essential. Replacing experienced professionals with politically aligned hires undermines oversight, mission readiness, and the long-term stewardship of taxpayer funds. This kind of politicization is not just harmful—it’s operationally dangerous.

Across the federal workforce, many of us have already witnessed policies being used not to improve performance, but to manufacture attrition and circumvent established protection... [truncated]">Anonymous Submission

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

This isn’t about addressing poor performance—it’s about giving more power to a few at the expense of the rest of us who show up every day, work hard, and serve the public under already stressful conditions. It puts our jobs and our families’ security at risk.

In my role, I focus on scientific research that helps ensure clean air and water for everyone in this country. This work is guided by facts and public health, not politics. To do it well, we need a civil service that’s nonpartisan and values expertise. Political interference would only get in the way of serving all Americans fairly and honestly.

Bringing back Schedule F would weaken accountability and performance across government. It opens the door to firing dedicated public servants not because of their work, but because of perceived political views. That’s a recipe for silencing experts, stifling innovation, and making it harder to make smart, informed decisions.

This rule also threatens the very foundation of our democracy. It would erode transparency, sideline science, and damage trust in government by replacing career professionals with political loyalists.

Comment: The proposed rule would constitute a threat to the non-partisan nature of the civil service itself. In addition, it creates the potential for political favoritism, which is already a concern more generally. Moreover, and most importantly, it detracts from the rights of civil servants.
A specific concern regards Sub–Part 2, &quot;Needed to Address Factors Inadequately Considered in Prior Rulemaking&quot;, Section ii &quot;Proposed Regulations are Necessary to Strengthen Democracy and Promote a Nonpartisan Civil Service&quot;.

However, attributions of intention such as the example cited here do not constitute a rationale for the Proposed Rule, as civil servants are expected to exercise their best judgment without fear of retaliation, as previously noted above.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

I oppose the NPRM&#039;s proposed changes. I worked for a federal agency as an attorney doing policy for different political administrations, including as a manager. The NPRM&#039;s changes are problematic for the following reasons:

1. Sometimes, administrations want to do ill-advised things due to Presidents wanting to respond in political ways. In my experience, it is not possible to have frank conversations about problematic policies if people are fearful that they can be fired for flagging issues or opposing the implementation of a poorly-conceived policy. It is unexceptional that each administration gets to decide its priorities, but the administration must still follow the law. This proposed regulation will make our country less safe and less effective because policy personnel like me do not feel comfortable discussing their concerns if it might frustrate any political appointees up the chain of command.

2. The regulation will turn a small problem into a big one. The NPRM does not categorize how many poor performers are doing policy work. In my experience, it is fewer than 1%. Also, while it is true that Performance Improvement Plans can take a few months to finalize, that is also true in the private sector where there are no MSPB protections. In my 10+ years in the federal government, I found the biggest reason for poor performers is... [truncated]">Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,”

I have spent the greater part of the past 30 years leading a medical research laboratory. Over this time, I have secured multiple grants from the NIH and other agencies, and published more than 300 scientific papers. I have also served on study sections that evaluate NIH and Department of Defense grants. I am intimately familiar with the rigorous, peer-driven process through which scientific proposals are reviewed and funded in this country.

I write with grave concern regarding proposed regulatory changes under Schedule F, particularly the possibility that career civil servants who oversee NIH operations and grant review processes could be replaced by political appointees — individuals who serve at the discretion of the prevailing administration and may be dismissed without cause.

Politics has no place in science. For decades, the U.S. scientific enterprise has thrived precisely because it has remained nonpartisan and merit-based. Our current system selects and funds the most promising research to advance the health and prosperity of the American public. This system depends on impartial, highly qualified scientists — individuals chosen for their scientific achievements and peer recognition — to guide funding decisions.

The proposed regulation to classify officials involved in grantmaking as policymakers will have negative impacts. Evaluation and recommendation of grant applications is not policymaking, it is objective scientific decision-making that must be conducted by those with sufficient expertise. Cures for the most challenging diseases including cancer and Alzheimer’s disease require the most significant investment of both money and time, and long-term planning is essential for these efforts.  Classifying high-level officials involved in grantmaking as policymakers will increase the turnover of those that make strategic decisions, negatively impacting long-term planning of scientific research.

Federally funded research adds to the economy. Multiple studies show that medical research funded through the NIH and other organizations generates new economic activity, estimated to be at least a 250% return on investment. Having political appointees without sufficient expertise in charge of funding decisions will diminish the rate of discoveries and cures, compromise innovation, reduce economic return and increase waste. The classification of officials involved in grantmaking as policymakers will promote disease and economic loss.

This proposed policy change is antithetical to the definition of science. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) should be driven by the goal to fund the best science that will inform our understanding of how to improve health outcomes for our citizens. This process will be degraded if subject to political whims. The awarding of grants should be for the purpose of driving science forward, not supporting political agendas, which frequently are absent of or even counter to scientific evidence. Commitment to scientific progress requires long-term investment, as science is a slow process when done correctly. Having leadership and other scientific positions frequently turn over as administrations change will lead to frequent stopping of research projects before they have addressed their funded goals, wasting tax-payer money in the process. Additionally, employees in this position should be making decisions in the interest of supporting the best science, not in the interest of maintaining their jobs because they fear political repercussions by “stepping out of line” with a given administration. Finally, this change would lead to appointees being hired based on political loyalties rather than scientific expertise, with disastrous results for the state of American scientific progress.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

I strongly oppose the administration&#039;s proposed rule that would reclassify tens of thousands of federal employees into a new job category—commonly referred to as “Schedule F”—which undermines the merit-based principles of the civil service and opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing.

This proposal threatens the fundamental integrity and impartiality of the federal workforce. The civil service exists to ensure that public servants are hired and retained based on competence, experience, and a commitment to serving the American people—not on their political loyalty. Allowing political appointees to replace qualified career officials with partisan allies would erode public trust, disrupt agency continuity, and diminish the quality and consistency of government services.

Public servants are not political operatives; they are professionals who work across administrations to implement laws and serve the public good. Politicizing these roles would have long-term, damaging consequences for effective governance, institutional memory, and democratic accountability.

I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reject this rule and uphold the long-standing principles of a nonpartisan, professional civil service. Our government functions best when expertise and public service—not political allegiance—guide personnel decisions.

Sincerely,
Kendra Martin

To have effective government it is imperative for public servants to be non-partisan in the performance of their duties and to be able to do their jobs without fear.  

This rule also removes due process.  There would be no checks and balances and a lot of power concentrated in fewer hands.  That is fertile ground for corruption, abuse, and a return to the old spoils system. This rule would literally set public service in America back 100 years. 

In addition, this proposed rule makes no sense as a means of addressing performance and conduct issues. If performance and conduct removals are truly a problem, it would make much more sense to review and revise those processes instead of pretending this rule would effectively address those problems and promote accountability and an effective government.  It won’t. In fact, implementation of this rule is more likely to promote inefficiency and potentially result in adverse effects to the public and our nation’s resources due to the far-reaching implications of abuse.

The proposal is to make it easier to fire certain government employees who “engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.   This sounds good on the surface, but has a fundamental flaw - it leaves employees vulnerable to a president who oversteps their authority.  

For example, if there ever were a situation where it was the President who engaged in misconduct,  or undermined the democratic process - such as by assuming Congressional powers - then it would be in the country’s best interest that these certain government employees NOT be so easily fired.   They would be a defense against the evils that might unfold.

To illustrate, let’s imagine the worst case::  a President, when running for election, claimed to not be associated with a radical minority who’s goal was to recast the nation according to their narrow and very unpopular vision.  Then, when elected, the President proceeded to issue dozens of Executive Orders that would seem to have been pre-written for him by members of that minority.   

If you are a Republican, imagine if that President is a Democrat.  If you are a Democrat, imagine if that President is a Republican. 

Again, I am adamantly against the proposed change.

Of course, civil servants will be less enthusiastic about following expectations of an administration they disagree with.  This is equally the case for conservative civil servants being asked to implement DEIA regulations as liberal civil servants to implement their removal. If the rule change was to make overtly defying your job expectations a basis for dismissal then this argument makes sense. Although, that is probably part of the regulations now so not a basis for a new rule.  Openly defying your job responsibilities is an act of civil resistance that civil servant - liberal or conservative - can take in response to an administration they morally can’t accept. And they can also bear the consequences of that civil disobedience.

What this rule change is functionally doing is to make more positions directly responsible to the President. Thus, people in those positions can be removed for disagreement with a Presidents policies or “lack of confidence” by the President that they will represent those policies. It is acknowledged but largely brushed over in this proposed rule change that one might object to this due to the fact that more positions can - and likely will - be changed by each administration. This brings in people who by definition have no history with the job, the context of previous decisions, the reasons things have gone wrong, etc.  This is like having new owners of company come in and fire up...

Schedule F represents a fundamental shift in how our government functions, one that would erode the core principles of professionalism, impartiality, and accountability in public service. By allowing thousands of career civil servants to be reclassified as political appointees, it gives any administration sweeping power to dismiss experts and replace them with individuals whose primary qualification may be political loyalty.

This is not just a staffing change—it’s a structural weakening of our democracy. The federal workforce exists to serve the American people, not the political interests of any one leader. Civil servants take an oath to uphold the Constitution and the law, not to serve the president. Their job is to provide honest, fact-based advice and to implement laws faithfully and consistently across administrations.

Schedule F undermines that mission. It creates a chilling effect where public servants may feel pressured to prioritize politics over truth or risk losing their jobs. That doesn’t just damage morale—it damages outcomes. When policies are made based on political expedience rather than expert analysis, the public suffers. Lives, livelihoods, and trust in government are put at risk.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

To Whom it May Concern,
As a Civil Servant with over two decades in public government, I find this proposed rule extremely troubling. While our country&#039;s leadership can change election-to-election, we rely on the bureaucracy to retain valuable institutional knowledge and provide nonpartisan ballast to the ship of government.

Reclassifying federal workers to enable firing for political reasons undermines the entire purpose of the civil service. Our country is meant to change slowly on purpose, to keep from whipsawing between extremes (both liberal and conservative) as the administration changes.

This rule would give more power to an already bloated executive branch, moving our country one step closer to authoritarianism. This is not merely a critique of the current administration, but of the presidency as a whole, which--over the last two centuries--has slowly expanded its authority to encompass powers that should rightfully belong to Congress and the Judiciary.

I ask you to please consider the effect of this proposed rule in the current, highly-partisan, political climate. By making Civil Servants easier to fire for political reasons, we let the country slip toward extremism, instead of trying to ensure it retains an even keel for decades to come.

And I, for one, find that unacceptable.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Evan Harker

“Schedule F” (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion.

Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000.
