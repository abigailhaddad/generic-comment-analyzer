I write in unequivocal opposition to this proposed rule, which seeks to reintroduce Schedule F--now rebranded as &quot;Schedule Policy/Career.&quot; While framed as a performance initiative, it is in reality a
blueprint for politicizing the federal workforce through a loyalty test to the President. It would dismantle core due process protections and turn career civil servants into at-will employees, vulnerable to dismissal for failing to conform to political ideology.
Let me be clear: I support performance-based accountability. I have worked under ineffective systems and know reform is needed. But this rule does not fix performance issues--it weaponizes
them. It enables sweeping reclassification of positions and eliminates the safeguards that protect employees from partisan retaliation and coercion. This is not about improving government--it is about consolidating power and silencing dissent.

I am writing to oppose the proposed rule, “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service (Docket No.OPM-2025-00040).”  

As a data analyst, I fear the proposed rule change will undermine the credibility of federal statistical data that informs research results and decision-making. 

Reclassifying positions considered “confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating character” undermines employees’ ability to work independently and objectively. This shift could expose federal statistical employees to political pressure, discouraging truthful analysis, encouraging methodological manipulation, and compelling premature data disclosures. Making it easier to remove staff for political reasons would prioritize loyalty over expertise due to fear of retribution, weakening the integrity of federal data systems and products.  

In a functioning free society, it is imperative for statistical agencies to remain free from political interference. Absent independence, public confidence will erode, and reliable analysis will not exist in the data these agencies produce.  
Federal statistical agencies rely on highly skilled professionals with deep technical knowledge and institutional experience.

The scientific process fundamentally depends on objectivity and independent expertise. By increasing the number of politically appointed employees in these positions, the federal granting agencies will become more susceptible to political influence, potentially leading to the implementation of policies that are not based on sound scientific principles and rigorous scientific evidence. This could have devastating consequences for public health, national security, technological advancement, and global competitiveness. 

Therefore, I urge the administration to reconsider Schedule F and instead prioritize a merit-based civil service that values expertise and impartiality. A system where scientists and experts are protected from political pressure is essential to ensure that grant assessment is not a matter of partisan politics (irrespective of the party in power), to promote the advancement of scientific knowledge, and to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the American people.">I would like to express serious concerns regarding the proposed implementation of Schedule F because of its potential to undermine the scientific integrity of the federal granting process.

Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.

Gail Harriss submits these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). 

I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.

1.	I am a retired lawyer who has worked with the Federal Government for much of my legal career representing disabled individuals in social security disability and SSI claims. I have also interacted with Federal employees in my capacity as a Race Director, for a Trail race on public lands for several years. I have also interacted with Federal employees when I have used public lands and visited National Forests, BLM lands and National Parks. 

2.	As a consumer of public services, it is very concerning to me that this Proposed Rule would politicize many civil service positions. Civil servants should be hired and retained based on their expertise and ability to perform the job, not their political affiliation and loyalty. Such a rule would undermine their integrity and trust that we give to our civil servants. When I have interacted with Federal employees, I have always been impressed with the skill and knowledge and expertise they... [truncated]">May 20, 2025

However, in this case, a single point made by OPM is instructive. Referring to employees said to be unofficially implementing their personal political agendas, OPM notes:

“the President has determined bureaucratic partisanship undermines his ability to execute the law and Schedule Policy/Career is necessary to combat this behavior.”

This comment appears to reflect the administration’s perception that there is a “deep state” operating within the bowels of the government that needs rooting out. I believe this to be an exaggeration of the facts.

In any event, the proposed rule would have the effect, intended or not, of concentrating even greater power in the hands of a president. That concentration of power, in turn, diminishes the checks on executive power that are already under threat by extreme partisanship.

Additionally, the professionalism and expertise of the federal workforce that are essential to good governance would be at risk with the adoption of the proposed rule. The vast powers a president already holds means the risk of degrading that professionalism and expertise far outweighs a single president’s concerns about his ability to implement his priorities.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.

This executive order issued by President Trump would reclassify hundreds of thousands of nonpartisan civil servants into roles more susceptible to political influence and control.
Under Schedule F, professional career federal employees would be left vulnerable to threats or intimidation from political appointees. This would effectively strip them of their ability and obligation to enforce the law or report fraud, waste, abuse, or illegal directives, putting their careers and well-being at risk.
Schedule F is part of a broader scheme to corrupt the Executive Branch for personal and political gain. By undermining oversight and dismantling laws and regulations designed to prevent corruption and political overreach, Schedule F is a critical component of a larger initiative known as Project 2025.
Civil servants must remain nonpartisan experts, accountable not only to the President but also to the Constitution, the law, the American people, and Congress. For 150 years, Congress has diligently worked to establish, protect, and enhance a stable, professional, and nonpartisan civil service.
I urge Congress to OPPOSE Schedule F and pass the Saving the Civil Service Act to protect the apolitical federal workforce, a cornerstone of modern democracy, from being undermined by unchecked and malicious political forces.

I am an attorney with over 13 years of federal government service, mostly working on civil enforcement matters for the Department of Justice. Civil servants working for the federal government have protections to ensure they can exercise professional judgment without fear of retaliation for saying or doing something simply because it is not in line with the preferences of leadership. For example, in the context of my work at DOJ, this means that an attorney can recommend for or against taking an enforcement action solely on the basis of an analysis of the facts and the law—without regard to what outcome leadership might, for political reasons, prefer. Under the Proposed Rule, civil servants categorized as “Schedule Policy/Career” would lack these critical protections. Based on my experience, I believe this will permit political pressure applied to DOJ attorneys to result in unjust actions that undermine the interests of the United States or stray outside of the authority delegated to DOJ by Congress.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

The creation of Schedule F under Executive Order 13957 in 2020 posed a fundamental threat to the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce. By allowing broad reclassification of career civil servants involved in “policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating” roles, Schedule F sought to erode the essential distinction between nonpartisan expertise and political loyalty. This undermines both the stability and effectiveness of government operations and threatens the impartiality and professionalism that are hallmarks of our civil service.
Although the stated intent of the current rule proposal is to enhance responsiveness and accountability, reintroducing policies that echo Schedule F would achieve the opposite. Such a move would inject instability into public institutions by fostering political interference in roles that should remain nonpartisan. It would open the door to mass dismissal of qualified professionals based on political considerations, weaken institutional memory, and diminish public trust in government agencies.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

I also live in a wildland-urban interface in a fire-adapted ecosystem and have been evacuated from my home for extensive periods of time and live surrounded by federal public lands.

 I am horrified by the plan to allow for the replacing of career program officers with political appointees.

The changes here are somewhat similar to the Schedule F initiative introduced in 2020, and what we know from GAO&#039;s review of that (GAO-22-105504) is that &quot;no agencies had placed positions into Schedule F by the time of the E.O.&#039;s revocation on January 22, 2021.&quot;  In fact, only two agencies showed any real interest in classifying employees in the new Schedule F designation.  So I don&#039;t see the real need for moving career federal employees into at-will arrangements.

Here are my specific concerns with this proposed rule:

* Agency heads will take a maximalist approach to define jobs that are “confidential, policy determining, policymaking or policy-advocating character”
* If career employees are classified as &#039;at-will&#039; employees, they are less likely to challenge illegal or unethical behavior
* Removing due process rules for federal employee dismissals will introduce MORE partisanship into our civil service, not less
* As mentioned in GAO&#039;s report on Schedule F, these changes are likely to have negative impacts upon recruitment and retention of talented employees, leading to a crippling loss of expertise and institutional memory

Further, Federal workers have accepted lower pay than they could earn in the private sector because of the certainty that they will be able to keep their job in the Federal government as long as they continue to perform their duties. Removing these protections will make it harder for the federal government to hire the most qualified individuals for the job. Finally, administrations can demand workers carry out duties that are on conflict with the law.

This policy would represent an unprecedented increase in the politicization of the federal workforce, threatening the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service. In my experience, working for over ten years and for two agencies in the federal government, the vast majority of employees are educated, skilled and knowledgeable experts in their fields. They are hired with no regard to political views or affiliations. In fact, by virtue of the Hatch Act, there are severe restrictions on their political activities. This rule would render positions highly vulnerable to political and partisan management. It would subject positions governed by this proposed rule change to partisan influence, and would inject elements of fear and bias into decisions by the position occupants. 

One especially harmful consequence of this proposed rule is that we are already suffering from is the loss of institutional knowledge. If positions turn over with each new administration, this would greatly impact the retention of long-term expertise. Such experts are only developed through many years of experience, which would no longer likely be possible in a service with frquent turnover.

Gabbard fires leaders of intelligence group that wrote Venezuela assessment
The director of national intelligence fired top officials weeks after their group authored an assessment contradicting President Donald Trumps legal rationale for deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has fired the top two officials at the National Intelligence Council, weeks after the council wrote an assessment that contradicted President Donald Trumps rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act and deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members without due process.
Gabbard removed Michael Collins, the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council, as well as his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekhof, according to a spokesperson for Gabbards office.
The actions are the latest purge by Gabbard, who has said she is fighting politicization of the intelligence community but has removed or sidelined officials perceived to not support Trumps political agenda.

Trump just took the next step toward giving himself the power to bypass the guardrails that are supposed to keep our basic government services free of political influence.

It’s hard to miss how many federal appointees are deeply unqualified (a 22 year old supermarket worker as head of an agency, really??)

This has been truly highlighted by an unelected bureaucrat in the federal government who has brought in unvetted (Big Balls, really??) inexperienced players to steal our private data for who knows what purposes.  Doing away with the protection for civil workers against political partisanship only opens the door to ever more nefarious projects. The fear to report such projects will be overwhelming for unprotected civil servants.

OPM’s new rule completely allows the executive branch to take full control and use civil servants for things American citizens will most likely have no awareness of an no means to have a say about.  It will NOT cut red tape and nor allow career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship. On the contrary, it will ENCOURAGE punishment for not following the executive ‘party line’ and justifying such punishment by terming it “poor job performance or misconduct” with no basis in fact.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed reinstatement and expansion of Schedule F. This policy represents a fundamental threat to the independence and integrity of our scientific institutions.

Scientific advancement relies on independence from political interference. The Schedule F proposal would reclassify tens of thousands of career civil servants—many of them scientific experts—as political appointees. This is not a minor bureaucratic change. Rather, it would strip essential job protections from those who steward federal scientific investments and would invite political coercion into decisions that must be grounded in scientific evidence.

My own research, like that of countless others, has been made possible through federal support from NIH. These institutions have long been effective precisely because they are staffed by scientists whose professional judgments are informed by peer review, scientific consensus, and statutory mandates—not by political loyalty. Redefining program officers and grant managers as &quot;policy-making&quot; staff eligible for political appointment fundamentally mischaracterizes their roles and opens the door to funding decisions based on ideology rather than merit.

Civil servants are already accountable through multiple oversight mechanisms. What this proposal would do, instead, is institutionalize political interferenc...

This rule represents a significant step forward in addressing critical issues in government efficiency and accountability. Having dealt for many years with government employees at the Department of Interior, I saw first-hand the lack of accountability or concern for efficiency among more than one member of the government staff at multiple levels. I also saw good employees get discouraged and leave the government for the private sector. These employees were conscientious hard workers who were told by fellow employees to “stop working so hard, you are making the rest of us look bad”. This type of attitude is a cancer that spreads throughout a workplace and kills efficiency and moral. It for this very reason that I am writing in support of this proposed rule.

Firstly, the proposed rule aligns with the principles of administrative law, ensuring that the statutory authority is upheld, and procedural requirements are met. By adhering to these principles, the rule promotes transparency, accountability, and fairness in the regulatory and employment process.

Secondly, the rule&#039;s potential impacts are highly beneficial for various stakeholders including hard working, ethical government employees who care about their jobs and are providing a service to their country.

This rule will politicize the IRS in a way that undermines the nonpartisan integrity that is essential to a fair and functional tax system.

Taxpayers depend on the IRS to apply the tax code impartially, without political bias. Politicizing IRS roles by creating a system where employees may be fired based on political loyalty risks eroding public trust, encouraging selective enforcement, and opening the door to political targeting of taxpayers.

IRS employees are trained experts who understand complex tax issues and serve under a professional code of ethics. Placing their jobs under political threat jeopardizes institutional knowledge, weakens enforcement consistency, and risks inefficient or uneven treatment of taxpayers.

This rule is a direct threat to the stability, fairness, and neutrality of one of the most sensitive arms of government. The tax system only works when it is seen as impartial. Politicizing the IRS would damage taxpayer confidence and reduce voluntary compliance, ultimately hurting both the government and the people it serves.

I urge you to withdraw this rule.">I am an individual speaking in my own personal capacity, and I strongly oppose this proposed rule, which would allow for the reclassification of federal civil servants into at-will positions.

The problematic language in the rule change is:

Civil servants undergo sometimes years long training to conduct important work for our country. They often have deep institutional, legal, policy, scientific, and/or practical knowledge that is essential for the conduct of critical functions. These functions include the efficient and legal implementation of current executive branch priorities. 

For example, at the National Institutes of Health, Health Scientist Administrators (e.g., Program Officers, Scientific Review Officers) are scientists that provide highly specialized expertise in the grantmaking process. Many have had many years long experience conducting science and undergo additional, specialized training to conduct their highly specialized work (e.g., identifying research needs, providing scientific and technical input as to suitability of applications for funding, assembling other experts with the expertise to assess scientific merit of specific applications, ensure reviews are conducted according to laws and policies). The proposed rule would remove civil service protections for these positions and could dramatically reduce the efficiency of agency if these changes result in frequent turnover in these cornerstone positions.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Reclassifying federal employees into an at-will employment category strips them of crucial civil service protections, making them vulnerable to termination without due process. This not only undermines the job security of dedicated civil servants but opens the door to political favoritism over merit. It threatens the nonpartisan foundation of our federal workforce—particularly in science, public health, and regulatory roles where expertise, not political loyalty, should determine employment, salary, etc.

This rule risks destabilizing essential government services. Removing experienced personnel from agencies responsible for national security, public health, and environmental protection could lead to dangerous gaps in continuity and effectiveness. As a result, Americans may experience slower responses in times of crisis and a decline in confidence in the federal government&#039;s ability to serve and protect them.

Additionally, this rule will cost taxpayers more, not less. Increased spending on political appointment salaries as favors, high turnover costs, legal challenges, and disruptions to service delivery will all lead to greater government expenditures without any guaranteed improvements in service. Politicizing the civil service will waste public funds and erode the integrity of institutions designed to serve the public impartially and to maintain continuity during changes in administration. ...

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category. The removal of such protection violates the Fifth Amendment due process rights of federal civil servants, specifically by removing the employees&#039; interest in their tenure protections.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

This new rule concerning Schedule F should not be enacted, especially in light of the overtly partisan and, frankly, vengeance-driven practices undertaken by the current administration, who have made no secret of the fact they hope to use it to stack the federal bureaucracy with political allies who will carry out the will of the president rather than focus on the well-being of the United States.

At the end of Ulysses S. Grant&#039;s presidency, a time of much corruption within a growing federal government in the wake of the Civil War, a commission that investigated the civil service of the time came to this conclusion: 

&quot;The practice of making appointments and removals in controlling reference to personal and partisan influence and spoils, directly and powerfully tended, in every grade of life, to discourage and overawe honest and manly thought and speech….the courage and fidelity that might, under a better system, have disclosed and removed great abuses were overawed and silenced.&quot; - 1874 report to President Grant

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).
