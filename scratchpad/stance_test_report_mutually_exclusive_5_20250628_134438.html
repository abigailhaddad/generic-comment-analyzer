Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

This plan jeopardizes the civil service system&#039;s foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.



Implementing Schedule F would lead to politicized employment decisions, contradicting the law&#039;s requirement for apolitical civil service. The broad and unclear criteria for Schedule F would also undermine due process rights, violating 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which demands cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Depriving thousands of workers of these protections would harm accountability and might silence experts, ultimately reducing government efficiency.



The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory obligation to protect the merit system under federal law (5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.). Introducing Schedule F would erode this duty by exposing career civil servants to inappropriate political pressure, ultimately weakening the consistency and professionalism of government programs.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

As with any company or business are there potential problems and inequities within the system?  Yes. Did I work with employees and bosses I would have fired for poor performance or not meeting the expectations of the job.  Absolutely.  However, I do not believe that the way to correct institutional problems is by destroying the system. It is done by addressing the policies, procedures and people that are ineffective and implementing corrective actions.  Actions, policies, procedures, codes of conduct/behavior and rules have consequences if not followed.  Those should be upheld. That is why the Government should make it their mission to hire qualified experts in their fields, creative, innovative, problem and solution solving employees that have the best interest of the agencies and people/groups they serve as their foremost mission. In my opinion what we DON&#039;T need is a government that has no interest in hiring the best and most qualified individuals foregoing them for people who may not have any qualifications, experience or expertise other than to agree to &quot;tow the line&quot; and swear an allegiance to an individual or a group of &quot;accepted ide...

Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

Adverse personnel actions are taken and upheld thousands of time in the federal service.
Particularly focusing these changes on grant-making employees highlights the dangers of politicizing the civil service. Funding decisions will be based on whether the proposal fits a worldview rather than its value. Thus, the United States will lose credence in the international arena. Fewer highly-qualified scientists and others will apply for jobs in the federal service.
Supervisors will have wide latitude to discipline subordinates with no independent review, based on little more than dislike or mere disagreement.
In short, this proposed reclassification has many downsides and few advantages. It will not improve the civil service but rather leave employees vulnerable to the whims of management.

As a scientist deeply familiar with the federal grantmaking process, I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule that would reclassify civil service positions involved in grant administration as political appointments under Schedule F.

Federal grantmaking, especially at institutions like the NIH, must be guided by scientific merit, peer review, and long-term vision — not political agendas. Reclassifying scientific leadership and program officers into policymaking roles subject to political removal will severely compromise the integrity of the process. The suggestion that evaluating grants or drafting funding opportunity announcements constitutes partisan policymaking is both inaccurate and dangerous.

Science thrives on continuity, independence, and expertise. This rule will undermine all three. If implemented, it risks turning NIH and other agencies into revolving-door institutions where long-term scientific strategy is replaced with short-term political gain.

I urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this rule and uphold the protections that ensure U.S. science funding remains world-class, fair, and nonpartisan.

Thank you for your time and consideration.">To Whom It May Concern,

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

The way to improve performance, accountability and responsiveness in civil service is to support employees through better pay and benefits,increased opportunities for job advancement and acknowledging that they play a critical role in the smooth operation of our government and the manner in which it functions.

My father, a Silver Star recipient for his service as a medic during WWII became employed by the United State Postal Service shortly after the war. He was able to support himself, a wife, and five children from a job that while it did not pay a whole lot, offered stability and good benefits. 

Government employees and indeed, the citizens of the United States deserve a well run government with healthy and robust cadre of civil servants.

There is no need for this sweeping revision of civil service that would upend many decades of a capable, non-partisan, and professional Federal workforce. 

The Federal civil service brings institutional knowledge and subject matter expertise essential to good governance.  This is a foundation that is important for political appointees; indeed, the President can already appoint more than 7,000 political appointees to oversee the Federal civil service.   Federal career employees understand very well that a new President has the right to carry out his policies guided by the Constitution and law as can be seen by the training, regulations, and outcomes in previous Administrations. The deep expertise of the Federal career workforce is a valuable asset to the people of the United States and to our functioning as a republic. 

The proposed regulations would put patronage over merit, subject career professionals to political abuse, and open the door to waste and corruption.  None of this would serve political appointees, the President, or the nation.  

I spent more than 30 years as a Federal career civil servant and of that, 14 years working for political appointees.  I was part of the support that career employees bring to make political appointees successful in carrying out the President’s policies: a sound working relationship, knowledge of issues, and knowledge of legal parameters.

While the scientific community waits to see what the new normal will be, the Trump administration has a plan to institutionalize a much more politicized structure of control over government broadly, including both public scientific investments in research and the use of scientific knowledge in policy actions.
The new Schedule F is shorthand for an executive order that will change policy away from one based on merit which means that career employees are therefore retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4,000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.

Dear OPM,

On behalf of RISE Stronger, we request an extension of the 30-day comment period provided for OPM’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” 90 FR 17182 (April 23, 2025). For context, RISE Stronger is a citizen watchdog organization of nearly 30,000 members that was formed in the wake of the 2016 election. Our mission is to ensure that the government and its leaders are accountable to its citizens, transparent in their actions and policies, and guided solely by the interests and values of the American people.

The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) does not establish a minimum comment period, but courts require agencies to provide a “meaningful opportunity to comment” on proposed rules. Forester v. CPSC, 559 F.2d 774, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Here, for a number of reasons, the 30-day comment period OPM has provided for this rulemaking is unlawfully short.

* INCONSISTENT WITH PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES. Presidential guidance since 1993 has instructed that agencies must afford the public “a meaningful opportunity to comment on any proposed regulation, which in most cases should include a comment period of not less than 60 days.” E.O. 12866 § 6(a), 58 FR 51735, 51740 (1993); see also E.O. 13563 § 2(b), 76 FR 3821-22 (2011) (“[E]ach agency shall afford the public a meaningful opportunity to comment...

Such a reclassification risks politicizing these critical roles, potentially undermining the fundamental integrity of scientific research and diminishing public trust in federally-funded science.

Career NIH employees, particularly SROs and POs, ensure the impartial review and management of research grants based on scientific merit and public health importance, independent of political influence. Introducing at-will employment conditions for these positions would threaten this essential impartiality, potentially leading to decisions influenced more by political alignment than by rigorous scientific evaluation.

Historically, instances where scientific decisions were perceived as politically influenced have significantly eroded public confidence. For example, previous policy shifts that were viewed as politically motivated in areas like environmental science and public health guidelines have led to skepticism and reduced compliance with scientifically-informed public health directives. The current structure helps protect the scientific decision-making process from such vulnerabilities.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to express my deep-seated opposition to the proposed rule entitled “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” which would reintroduce elements of the previously rescinded Schedule F executive order.

I am profoundly concerned that this rule would fundamentally undermine the merit-based principles that are the cornerstone of the career civil service. It threatens to erode the nonpartisan integrity and institutional expertise that our government relies upon to serve the American people effectively and lawfully. Civil servants take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Their expertise helps the leaders elected by the American people to execute their vision. Allowing partisan hires, not based on skills, experience, and expertise will slow the work of the government and render it ineffective. Civil servants are charged with executing their leader’s vision and do not allow their subjective opinions to influence the outcome. In addition, the amount of time to staff up with new employees after each election would result in lost knowledge, unfinished projects, and a lack of results for the American people. 

The widespread mass reclassification of policy-related roles would remove essential due process protections for civil servants and... [truncated]">Subject: Comment in Opposition to the Proposed Rule on “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (Schedule F)

Schedule F is a way to further weaken agency administrative expertise in favor of political goals that may not align with the needs and desires of the American people. 

It is extremely important that the United States government continues to be staffed by experts with advanced, specialized knowledge on the management and oversight of government activities. This expertise, combined with a degree of independence, ensures that the American people have consistent, quality management of the federal government across administrations. 

While the executive may desire more coersive control over government administrators, having independent administrators and experts ensure that the American people are not subject to the capricious whims of executives that do not necessarily have the full interests of the American people in mind. 

There are already numerous opportunities for executives to implement political appointees at the top levels of agencies to drive policy. But the United States government should always take the long view on what&#039;s best for the country. While many political appointees have expertise in the areas they have been appointed to manage, it&#039;s recently clear that many do not. You might imagine that those without expertise in the areas they have been chosen to manage would rely more heavily on the expert...

Preserving civil service protections is critical for preserving our leadership in medical research and care. Science requires open inquiry and innovative research that pushes our knowledge and health care forward toward continued leadership. Civil service protections create the space to support scientific research without fear of arbitrary or politically motivated disciplinary actions. In contrast, federal scientists who fear dismissal for political reasons are less likely to offer candid analyses or pursue cutting-edge research.
If federal agencies are to recruit top talent to drive high-quality science, these protections are needed. Removing civil service protections will make it more difficult to attract and retain highly qualified scientists and others with technical expertise based on concerns that they will not have the independence needed to pursue their research.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

The impacts of this proposed rule will upend decades of reforms which have strengthened the federal workforce and opens up the opportunity for blatant corruption and nepotism. 
 
Moreover, these changes undermine the very principles that the Trump administration claims to be promoting. These changes would allow civil service to be decided based on a loyalty test of party - akin to the Chinese Communist Party. Rather than the merit based system that currently exists, it would restrict those in the federal service to those who blindly follow the ideological whims of whichever party is in power, undermining freedom of thought and allowing for the persecution of political views. It will undermine American competitiveness as unpopular views are suppressed entirely and each change in administration comes with head-spinning, full-scale changes in the composition of federal employees.

Risk of Insider Threats and Foreign Interference

The proposed rule&#039;s emphasis on rapid hiring and the reduction of background investigation timelines could compromise the thoroughness of security vetting processes. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has been working to streamline personnel vetting policies, aligning standards for background investigations and suitability determinations.   However, accelerating these processes without adequate safeguards may lead to insufficiently vetted individuals entering sensitive positions.  This could increase the risk of insider threats, where employees may exploit their access for malicious purposes. 

Furthermore, the expedited hiring procedures might attract individuals with ulterior motives, including foreign agents seeking to infiltrate government agencies. The current vetting process, which includes continuous evaluation and the use of consolidated Personnel Vetting Questionnaires, is designed to mitigate such risks.

Schedule F, as introduced by the current administration would allow broad reclassification of federal employees involved in &quot;policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating&quot; roles, stripping them of their due process and merit-based civil service protections. This reclassification would open the door to mass politicization of the civil service, undermining a foundational principle of American democracy: that government professionals serve the public interest—not the political interest of any one administration.

Erosion of Merit-Based Employment

The core of the U.S. civil service system is its reliance on merit-based hiring and retention. By creating a new class of federal employees exempt from competitive hiring and procedural protections, Schedule F undermines this foundation. It risks turning experienced, apolitical experts into political appointees subject to loyalty tests and partisan whims. Numerous reports, including those from the Partnership for Public Service and the Government Accountability Office, have documented how politicization of the civil service leads to inefficiency, loss of institutional knowledge, and damage to public trust.

This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.

The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.

While misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with &quot;undermining the democratic process&quot; sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.

The American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution—not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reject this rule and protect the integrity of the merit...

These roles are critical to the fair and objective distribution of federal research funding. Reclassifying them as political appointments undermines the long-standing principles of nonpartisan, merit-based decision-making that are foundational to the U.S. scientific enterprise. Program Officers and scientific review officials must be guided by scientific expertise, evidence-based judgment, and rigorous peer review processes—not by political alignment.

Politicizing these positions risks:
1. Eroding public trust in the integrity and fairness of federal grantmaking,
2. Disrupting continuity in the oversight and administration of research portfolios,
3. Driving away highly qualified experts who may be unwilling to serve in politically vulnerable roles, and
4. Creating instability in a system that supports critical research across health, defense, environment, technology, and education.

Our federal research infrastructure must remain independent, credible, and protected from partisan influence. I urge you to preserve the current structure of these positions as career civil service roles to maintain the integrity, excellence, and long-term impact of federally funded research.

I urge the Office of Personnel Management in the strongest possible terms not to go through with this proposed rule. Politicizing grantmaking positions at NIH and other research-funding agencies would be catastrophic for science in the US and for the long-term health of citizens.

Below, I explain two major reasons why this proposed rule would be so disastrous:
(1) A lack of dependably stable, long-term funding will reduce scientific innovation.
(2) Politicizing NIH will degrade the scientific integrity of research done in the US.


(1) The importance of stable, long-term funding:

Scientific research requires long, steady investment. It can take years to get a new experiment working, let alone to collect data and turn that data into a useful finding that advances the field. Especially for major incurable diseases of our time—like Alzheimer&#039;s, Parkinson&#039;s, and various types of cancer—breakthroughs in finding a cure require decades of fundamental research into understanding the biological mechanisms of the disease, followed by years more research to find effective treatments.

A recent study has shown that science is most innovative when labs are given the opportunity to dive deep into a narrow topic for a long time: https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/article/10.1007/s11192-025-05295-1

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.
