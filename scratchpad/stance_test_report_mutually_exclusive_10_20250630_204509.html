Since we know multiple people who have been disabled by long COVID, we know the importance of everyone having access to regular updated COVID vaccines to prevent severe illness and likelihood of long term consequences. Continuing to provide vaccine access for all preventable diseases is sound science and good policy. Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efﬁcacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

For example, in my lifetime people no longer need to be vaccinated for Smallpox because the disease has been eradicated world wide. However, that is only possible because people of all ages, all over the world, did receive the Smallpox vaccine and as a result the disease has died out.  This is a modern day miracle and one which was beginning to become possible for other diseases such as HIV/AIDS.  

However due to Vaccine skeptics like Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr. we can also see clearly the backwards &quot;slide&quot; of highly contagious diseases such as Measles.  There are thousands of parents of young children who have decided that childhood diseases do not actually require vaccinations.  They think that the vaccines are more dangerous to the diseases.  They are able to think this way because they, themselves, are young enough NOT to have experienced those diseases personally thanks to their own parents who took the advice of their pediatricians and vaccinated them.

1. Thimerosal in the multi-dose flu vials

Thimerosal should either be replaced with a less neurotoxic preservative, or the instructions for use (on the box and insert, which, regrettably, recipients seldom see, if ever) should explicitly exclude pregnant women and children. The ghost of the Simpsonwood meeting&#039;s neurotoxicity revelations will forever hang over mercury as long as it remains in any vaccine.

2. COVID-19 injections

Though you are not taking a vote on these today, the record of death and destruction (neurological, cardiovascular, reproductive, and oncologic) amassed by the mRNA injections would have long ago forced their removal from the market by any previously accepted standards. 

The role of the modified spike protein in all this, both in terms of its longevity and multitude of mechanisms of damage to both tissue and multiple aspects of the immune system, should at least force its replacement in the injections by the nucleocapsid protein, which has shown a greater efficacy in terms of disease prevention. This should be easy, given the turn-on-a-dime antigen claims of the mRNA technology industry. 

However, in a growing number of studies, mRNA technology has, in and of itself, proven to be a significant danger. This has been shown to be...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. These individuals are not making policies that help the public. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only...

CDC ACIP should represent the gold standard in evidence-based, apolitical recommendations. Instead, the HHS secretary has done exactly what he promised not to do during confirmation: purge career experts in favor of unqualified individuals who seek to gain personal advancement and power by seeding doubt and confusion about proven vaccine science. This will kill people. This will make people sick, especially children, as we have already seen with recent outbreaks. The chilling effect on vaccine uptake is already hurting people; this group must represent a bulwark against vaccine backsliding so that we can follow real science as led by actual experts. Diseases live in the objective, evidence-based world, and they will not stop because of a political shift.
