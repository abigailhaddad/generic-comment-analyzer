These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Grant-making is not policy-making and it is concerning that it is viewed that way.  Grant-making has the goal of supporting work to increase scientific knowledge. Grants should be reviewed and funded based on the quality and potential of the science they propose. Science is non-partisan and non-political.  

Civil service protection has been in place for generations of non-partisan workers who are devoted to serving their country.  We will not be able to recruit the best, unbiased people to these roles if their job security depends on the views and whims of political factions.

American science is already handicapped by short-term appropriations, e.g., annual appropriations for the NIH, making it harder to fund long-term projects.  Scientific advances take time, often years.  The turnover produced by politicizing appointments at NIH and other funding agencies would be damaging.

Experience and expertise matter a great deal, and this approach risks bringing in people with insufficient experience and expertise to make good decisions.">I am Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and want to register an additional comment to highlight the problems associated with this proposed change in legislation.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

This is unacceptable in any workforce, especially one entrusted with implementing the laws of the United States. These policy staff are not mere functionaries; they influence key government decisions and must be accountable when they fail to do their jobs or act in bad faith.

Creating an at-will category for policy-influencing employees is a modest, common-sense reform.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

Undermining the Merit System and Civil Service Protections

The foundation of the federal civil service is the principle of merit-based employment insulated from political interference. Converting long-standing career positions into at-will roles—especially under the ambiguous label of “policy-influencing”—threatens to subvert this core principle. Civil service protections were instituted precisely to prevent loyalty-based purges and ensure continuity, competence, and nonpartisan governance across administrations. The proposed rule opens the door to politically motivated dismissals disguised as performance issues, chilling dissent and discouraging civil servants from providing frank, fact-based advice.

Ambiguity and Abuse of the “Policy-Influencing” Designation

The category of “policy-influencing” roles is vague and ripe for overreach. Nearly every executive agency position may, at times, touch on policy implementation or advice.

This rule would meaningful degrade if not completely erase this system.

We have strong civil service merit rules in place; people hired into consequential positions necessarily have strong credentials to prove their expertise in their field. Politicians do not have this expertise. The statutes and regulations governing the civil service recognize this fact, and have worked to allow these experts to operate independently with the knowledge that reprisal would only result from failure to prioritize the public interest. The proposed rule would invert this prioritization.

In practice, the proposed rule would empower political appointees to override the judgement of civil servants.

They do work slowly, or badly, or leak, or hide information, or lie, if they don&#x27;t support the policies the politicals are pushing. And none of that happens if they support them. Everything this rule says about some Feds doing what they want instead of what the President wants is true. Not everyone does this, but a good number do. I know this for a fact and have seen it. In Trump&#x27;s first term a policy document I was working on got leaked in its entirety to the Press. This happened because a fellow Fed hated it and wanted to get the administration to drop the policy. I know who leaked it too. And if I was President, and trying to get stuff done I cared about, and career employees were trying to do their own thing, I would be pissed too. And I would want the power to tell them to cut it out. So the problem this rule is aimed at is real and I get why Trump wants it. That is all.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Since these positions are integral to federal grant-making, it is important to have scientific experts who can make decisions about important scientific research that should be funded, and evaluate if that research will be conducted properly and rigorously. Having the NIH run by political appointees will inevitably put people in charge swayed by political agenda, which will have adverse outcomes on grant awards, the quality of research being conducted, and our faith in the accuracy of scientific findings. To develop long-term plans to make scientific progress that can find treatments for devastating diseases, we need directors who will maintain their positions for longer periods of time. Instead, if these are done by political appointment, there will be frequent turnover in these positions, stalling scientific progress and advancement.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

2.	Peer review for NIH and other agencies is mandated by federal law.

The last few months have shown us that presidents who choose to do so can influence, retaliate, and coerce beyond the powers given them by the Constitution of the United States. President Trump in a short time has established a track record of politicizing everything from US departments to independent entities beyond the powers rightfully given to him. He has abused his powers to retaliate against those he views as opponents, just because they do not support him and his policies. He has negatively impacted the effective functioning of our government and has created a constitutional crisis with his overreach. In order for our government to function properly we need civil servants with experience in their fields to work without fear of retaliation because of who hired them or because of the political party they are registered to vote with. It will create an atmosphere of fear. Giving the president and his appointees more political influence over the civil service will only exasperate an already tense and difficult situation. I am extremely concerned that allowing Section F to be implemented will put our countries democratic tradition at further risk.

As a private attorney who has spent my legal career exclusively representing federal employees in employment matters, I cannot help but deduce that the title of this proposed rule is the exact opposite of what the actual results will be if the proposed rule is implemented.

Federal employees are public servants who are subject to the rigorous salary caps imposed by the federal government. They do not work in public service for fame or fortune; rather, the stability and job security traditionally associated with government employment tend to be major draws for hard-working, high-performing individuals to work in civil service. By removing appeal rights and other due process protections from a potentially sizeable segment of federal jobs, those hard-working, high-performing individuals who were willing to trade high-salary private sector jobs for the stability of government service will undoubtedly look elsewhere for work. 

As noted in the Proposed Rule, if the proposed rule is implemented, there will be no need for employees in Schedule Policy/Career jobs to serve a probationary or trial period, because, in essence, the entirety of their government career will be spent in a probationary period, in which they are constantly at risk of being terminated for no reason whatsoever, without any viable recourse.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

These individuals are not political operatives; they are subject-matter experts whose evaluations ensure that taxpayer-funded research is grounded in merit, rigor, and peer-reviewed standards. Turning these critical roles into politically appointed positions threatens to inject ideology into what must remain an impartial and evidence-based process. Such a change would erode public trust in the objectivity of science agencies, chill open scientific discourse, and compromise the fairness and credibility of grant evaluations. Federal research funding decisions must remain shielded from political interference to preserve innovation, public health, and national competitiveness. Such a move would also dissuade qualified experts from participating in federal review panels, degrade the quality of scientific input into national decision-making, and ultimately erode the integrity of federally funded research.
For these reasons, I urge you to reject any application of Schedule F to scientific personnel and preserve the independence and integrity of America’s science agencies.

Why rely on experienced civil servants who’ve spent decades mastering complex laws and regulations when you could replace them with someone whose only qualification is retweeting your press releases? That’s not just governance — that’s influencer governance.

Let’s be honest, nothing ruins a good plan like a federal employee who actually knows the law and tells you you can’t violate it. The Schedule policy/career solves this pesky problem by making sure the only people left in government are those who say, “Yes sir, absolutely, let’s put the EPA under the Department of Vibes.”

Why have a workforce that remembers what went wrong last time when you can have one that doesn’t remember what happened this morning? The Schedule policy/career is basically the Etch A Sketch of public administration — shake it up and start over every four years (or every time someone gets a mean quote in Politico).

Sure, the administration that floated this idea lost lawsuits like it was an Olympic sport. But that’s just part of the fun! Why follow legal procedure when you can boldly charge into the courts with unconstitutional policies and then blame the “biased judges” for being able to read?

Furthermore the evidence that supervisors have difficulty firing employees for poor performance is largely based on lower level employees and is largely therefore disconnected from the employees like to be affected by this proposed change. The supposed benefits of the proposed classification are significantly outweighed by the likely risks of significant politicization from the order’s emphasis on vesting decision making in a single politician , President Trump, and an unspecified staff, removing it from an established and professional agency and process.

As Pam Herd and Don Moynihan recently wrote,
“ Studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.
What might this mean for scientific agencies? Agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) cannot meet their statutorily mandated scientific missions if politics, rather than scientific expertise, drive decision-making. Federally supported science has been so successful, in no small part, because agency staff are typically expert scientist...

Introduction

I am submitting this comment as an academic physician-scientist with more than a decade of experience conducting NIH-funded research at Massachusetts General Hospital with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As a researcher with extensive experience in the NIH grant system, I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the section of the proposed rule that designates employees with &quot;substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking&quot; as potentially occupying &quot;policymaking positions&quot; that could be reclassified under Schedule Policy/Career.

Specific Concerns with the Proposed Rule

The proposed rule identifies grant-making as &quot;an important form of policymaking&quot; and suggests that employees with &quot;substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.&quot; This characterization fundamentally misunderstands the scientific grant review process at agencies like NIH and NSF, which rely on scientific merit and peer review rather than political considerations.

The stated purpose of this rule is to allow agencies to &quot;quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.&quot; When applied to...

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule (OPM-2025-0004). This proposal threatens the foundational principles of a merit-based, nonpartisan federal civil service.

The proposed rule would reclassify federal positions, effectively stripping these employees of their rights, including the ability to appeal adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This change would convert these roles into at-will positions, allowing for dismissal without cause or notice. Such a move undermines the merit system principles that have long safeguarded the integrity and professionalism of the federal workforce .

By enabling the reclassification of policy-influencing positions without clear criteria or employee consent, the rule opens the door to politicization of the civil service. Employees could be removed based on political considerations rather than performance, compromising the objectivity and continuity essential to effective governance.

The proposed rule lacks transparency in its implementation. Employees may not be notified of their reclassification, and there is no requirement for agencies to provide justification for such changes. This opacity erodes trust in the system and leaves employees vulnerable to arbitrary actions .

I am writing in my personal capacity; all views and positions expressed by me are solely my own and in no way represent the views or position of my employer.

I strongly oppose the implementation of Schedule F. Civil service protections exist to ensure federal employees can perform their duties free from political influence or retaliation. This proposed rule risks compromising our public institutions&#x27; neutrality, expertise, and effectiveness by allowing positions to be filled based on political affiliation rather than professional qualifications or scientific expertise.

Currently, based on 42 U.S.C. 284, the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is the only political appointee at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Expanding political appointments to include all NIH Institute and Center Directors and potentially division directors would drastically politicize these critical roles. Such a change would increase turnover, disrupt long-term strategic planning, and significantly hinder the agency&#x27;s ability to execute its mission effectively.

Furthermore, reclassifying roles with discretionary authority over scientific grant funding decisions threatens to introduce political considerations into the rigorous, merit-based review processes essential for scientific advanceme...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

This would allow the current and future Presidents to reclassify tens of thousands of government jobs as “policymaking positions”, as outlined in Section 1.B (Executive Orders 13957, 14003,14171, and the Prior OPM Rulemaking), part 2 (Executive Order 14171).   

I have many concerns about this change throughout the government, but will write specifically about my profession.  As a practicing researcher in immunology and molecular biology for decades, and a former Special Government Employee as a Member of the National Cancer Institute Board of Scientific Counselors, I am very aware of the operations of NIH and the decisions that go into funding grants on the NIH or intramural campus, and extramural grants across the country.  It is essential that decisions on areas of emphasis be made on a rigorous scientific basis, free from ideologic and political bias, which are subject to the vicissitudes of four year political cycles.  Arbitrary political appointments  of Institute, Center Directors and Division Directors could undermine the integrity of the scientific review process.

This rule would grant the executive branch the power to convert tens of thousands of career civil servants—estimated at over 50,000—into at-will political appointees, thereby dismantling the professional, nonpartisan civil service on which democratic governance depends.

Schedule F is an unprecedented assault on the merit-based principles of the federal workforce. Its core premise—removing civil service protections from policy-related positions—opens the door to politicized hiring, mass firings of non-loyalists, and loyalty tests that undermine the independence, stability, and institutional memory of our government. In practice, this reclassification would not enhance accountability but erode it by suppressing dissent and enabling ideological conformity at the expense of evidence-based decision-making.

The proposed rule dangerously expands the definition of “policy-determining” and “policy-advocating” roles to include scientists, analysts, and grantmaking staff in agencies like NIH and NSF—professionals whose expertise is essential for upholding statutory mandates. Similar politicization has already had chilling effects on federal science, including the suspension of research grants, silencing of experts, and mismanagement that impedes agency effectiveness.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Schedule F would have dangerously politicized the federal workforce by stripping career civil servants of their long-standing protections. It would have allowed mass reclassifications and removals based on loyalty rather than competence, effectively turning large numbers of public servants into at-will employees. This is not how a healthy democracy operates.

We depend on a nonpartisan, professional civil service to implement the laws passed by Congress and serve the American people with continuity and expertise — regardless of which party holds the White House. Undermining that neutrality through something like Schedule F would erode public trust, chill honest advice, and drive away talent.

I support this rule because it puts up critical guardrails against that kind of abuse. It protects merit-based hiring, due process, and the principle that government service is about serving the public — not political agendas.

Please finalize this rule and consider strengthening it further to ensure future administrations cannot easily dismantle these protections again. The civil service is a cornerstone of effective, accountable governance, and it deserves our full protection.">I’m writing to express strong support for the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule to prevent the reimplementation of policies like Schedule F.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

First, the rule undermines the ability of the federal government to recruit and retain a competent workforce. By removing workplace protections from individuals without significant policymaking authority, the rule undermines the ability of the government to retain talented employees, who will be subject to the whims of the Executive. The rule fails to provide evidence that supports its views that the number of employees it seeks to categorize as Schedule F is appropriate in order to effectuate its goals.

Second, the rule lacks reason. The concerns about workplace protections making it difficult to remove employees is applicable to all federal employees, and a rule that only targets mid-level employees is not carefully tailored to address this problem.

Third, the rule relies on factual conclusions that are unsupported by evidence. To give one example, there is no evidence that federal employees &quot;use their positions to advance their personal political or policy preferences,&quot; and again, the rule itself is not tailored so as to address this concern in a rational way.

Fourth, the rule fails to articulate an appropriate delegation of authority to the director of OPM, and may run afoul of nondelegation concerns.

Docket ID OPM-2025-0004
RIN 3206-AO80

I am strongly opposed to this proposed rule change. Civil service protections are in place for a reason, to ensure that we attract and retain experienced federal workers. Our civil workers have specific expertise and experience and have a sense of history, having worked for multiple administrations. This knowledge is valuable to the offices they hold and to provide context for why certain regulations, decisions, protections were carried out a certain way in the past. We have seen over the past few months haphazard cutting of staff. AI generated letters that informed probationary staff they were fired for &quot;performance reasons&quot; regardless of their actual performance, resulting in us firing those who&#x27;s only fault was being recently hired or promoted.

I fail to see any legitimate reason for this proposed regulation. Presently, employees can be, and always have been, able to be removed for poor performance or for misconduct. This proposal is simply an excuse to terminate employees for any reason, including not singing the praises of leadership loudly enough, to frankly, not wearing the executive&#x27;s favorite color.  This proposal, if adopted, represents a steep erosion of both common sense and objective fairness.  Public employees not tools of partisanship, nor were they intended to be.

This plan jeopardizes the civil service system&#x27;s foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.



Implementing Schedule F would lead to politicized employment decisions, contradicting the law&#x27;s requirement for apolitical civil service. The broad and unclear criteria for Schedule F would also undermine due process rights, violating 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which demands cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Depriving thousands of workers of these protections would harm accountability and might silence experts, ultimately reducing government efficiency.



The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory obligation to protect the merit system under federal law (5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.). Introducing Schedule F would erode this duty by exposing career civil servants to inappropriate political pressure, ultimately weakening the consistency and professionalism of government programs.

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  In other words, the Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations.
 
We have seen nationally and in cities like my own city of Chicago how a &quot;spoils system&quot; or a patronage system is corrosive to the human spirit leading to elevation of incompetence and corruption. It is a system based on fealty not fairness and is contradictory to President Trump&#x27;s stated goal of efficiency in government.

I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule for the following reasons:
I have had many occasions to deal with government agencies and appreciate the dedication of our federal employees. If anything, I feel their jobs are made harder by a lack of investment, such as software upgrades, in our government agencies over the years. I do not feel this proposed rule is the answer to improving performance, accountability and responsiveness in the Civil Service. Furthermore, the rule appears vague and open to interpretation as to what jobs will fall under its classification.

One need look no further than the recent chaotic firings, and re-hiring in some cases, of federal employees to know that this proposed rule will not serve the American people. Taking action quickly does not necessarily equate with doing something well. Our civil servants are meant to serve the public, not a particular president, but federal employees have been fired for purely political reasons, and their valuable expertise has been lost. Inspector Generals were fired en masse by an administration that purportedly desires to root out waste, fraud and abuse, the very job they performed, and no justification was given.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

              title="Schedule F has been criticized for several reasons, particularly regarding how it could affect the careers and rights of federal government employees. Here are some key reasons why it’s viewed negatively by many:

1. Undermines Civil Service Protections
Schedule F allows for the reclassification of federal employees in policy-related positions, stripping them of many traditional civil service protections—like due process before termination. This means employees could be fired more easily, potentially for political reasons rather than performance.

2. Threatens Nonpartisan Expertise
Federal employees are expected to serve administrations of both parties with nonpartisan expertise. Schedule F opens the door to politicizing roles that should remain impartial, possibly filling them with political loyalists instead of qualified professionals.

3. Creates Job Insecurity
With fewer protections, federal workers may be more hesitant to express concerns or dissent on policy matters. This could lead to self-censorship or fear of retaliation, undermining the integrity and openness that good governance requires.

4. Risks Brain Drain
The instability and politicization could drive away experienced professionals from public service, making it harder to attract and retain top talent. Government agencies might lose institutional knowledge and continuity.

Rapid turnover of skilled employees due to easier firings and political reshuffling can impair the effecti...

The surveys of Federal managers who believe that they cannot fire an employee do not necessarily support the rule proposed here.  You failed to consider adequately the alternative approach of simply better training Federal managers about the processes for removing employees who engage in misconduct or who are poor performers.

Your statements that employees who are at risk of dismissal are those who fail to perform adequately or who engage in serious misconduct are the ones at risk of dismissal are flatly false.

I am alarmed by the proposal in OPM-2025-0004 to replace current Directors and Division Directors of the NIH (who are non-partisan civil servants) with partisan, political appointees. There are three main reasons I am against this change. (1) It will erode public trust in science if scientific funding is viewed as being driven by political motives. (2) Political appointees clearly do not have the required, high level of expertise in scientific and health matters. (3) Basic science is a long game over many years. In contrast, political appointments are short. Tacking a major goal (like sequencing the human genome) takes focused effort and support over many years. If funding is granted in one term and pulled back the next, the previous work and taxpayer investment is lost. I strongly oppose OPM-2025-0004 and I urge lawmakers to do the same.">I am a professional scientist who has served on grant evaluation panels at the National Science Foundation, and many of my close colleagues have served on grant evaluation panels at the National Institutes of Health.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

I urge OPM to immediately halt implementation of this rule until a thorough analysis, greater transparency, and proper procedural safeguards are in place.

Body:
1. Procedural Irregularities and Lack of Transparency
OPM is not following customary rulemaking procedures for a change of this magnitude. The agency appears to be bypassing the draft rule and advance notice requirements that are standard for significant regulatory changes. Given the broad impact on federal employment, OPM should have provided ample opportunity for public input and placed this rule on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking list.

The rule’s development and decision-making process have not involved a Senate-confirmed appointee, which is inappropriate for a change affecting tens of thousands of current and future federal careers. Such a consequential decision demands the highest level of accountability and oversight.

There is evidence that agencies have already developed and, in some cases, communicated plans to convert employees to Schedule Policy/Career before the final rule is issued. For example, NOAA reportedly notified its employees of impending conversion, suggesting that large-scale plans are advancing prematurely. This undermines the integrity of the rulemaking process and violates administrative procedure n...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

This is a terrible idea across the board. The federal government manages the country through long term strategies that should not be vulnerable to political changes on short time scales. Constant disruptions of programs (many of which were created by bipartisan effort) for political whims means that progress will stall. This is true of every area of the government -- the loss to our capacity to innovate and respond to threats due to Elon Musk&#x27;s wanton disruption of our agencies will take decades to recover from, if we recover at all. In no area is this more true than in the sciences and medicine.

One of the reasons that so much scientific creativity and excellence has flourished in the United States until this year, is that federal employees who are in charge of science agencies and grant and contract review do not make decisions about what to fund based on short-term changes in the political winds. Their civil service protections allow them to cultivate a long-term view of progress. They solicit proposals from experts to meet broad areas of interest, which stimulates creative proposals from a wide variety of perspectives. The agency employees themselves are experts, recruited because they broadly understand the domain that they oversee -- they are not patronage hires, not TV commentators, they are people who know the job.

This proposal undermines foundational principles of merit-based civil service, invites undue political interference, will lead to less effective staff as this loosening of protections will cause more fear and worry and less time doing their work, and risks violating statutory and constitutional protections.

To go into more detail: 
Schedule F represents a sweeping change to the civil service system that bypasses the competitive hiring process and allows for the removal of career professionals without cause. This contravenes the intent of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and longstanding statutory protections under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which are designed to ensure that federal employment decisions are based on merit, not politics.

Federal employees in competitive service positions have a constitutionally recognized expectation of due process before being removed. Reassigning them to Schedule F without cause strips them of these protections, potentially violating the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court has affirmed that such employment can create a property interest (see Loudermill, 1985), which cannot be taken away arbitrarily.

Schedule F blurs the line between career professionals and political appointees. It risks creating a chilling effect in which federal employees may feel pressured to align with political views rather than carry out ...

              title="Strongly opposed. Article VI of the US Constitution requires federal employees to take an oath of office to support the Constitution. Not the president or the administration, but the Constitution. Removing civil service protections from large numbers of employees dilutes this oath, plain and simple.

Now to the nitty gritty. OPM claims that reclassified employees “are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration.” (Source: Proposed rule, p. 6) Nice as far as it goes, but a mere lack of requirement is completely empty without civil service protections. What can it possibly mean that employees are not required to support the current administration’s policies if there is nothing protecting them from being fired for that reason, or for some pretextual reason?

OPM also seeks a broad interpretation of the statutory definition that justifies eligibility for reclassification: “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character”. OPM wants to ignore previous practice, legislative history, and anything that might place common-sense limits on this definition. The original executive order creating Schedule F offers a list of characteristics that justify reclassification including “viewing ... proposed regulations, guidance, executive orders, or other non-public policy proposals or deliberations”.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed reinstatement of Schedule F, as detailed in the Federal Register notice “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” . This policy threatens to undermine the integrity, efficiency, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service, with far-reaching consequences for governance and public trust.

The erosions of merit based civil service protections is dangerous and frankly lazy. Performance issues in the government, similar to any large corporate entity, are very real but a well thought out policy and revision to hiring practices and performance reviews could have alleviated this. The implementation of Schedule F would reclassify a significant number of career civil servants into positions that lack traditional job protections, effectively making them at-will employees. This shift contravenes the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which sought to eliminate the patronage system and ensure that government positions are filled based on merit rather than political affiliation. By allowing for the dismissal of employees based on perceived political loyalty, Schedule F risks reinstating a system of favoritism and undermining the professionalism of the civil service. ￼We have historical precedent, both American and in foreign governments, that this is a mistake. ￼

The cost analysis fails to account for the broader chilling effect on the federal workforce. Even if a position is not converted, a smaller scale initial conversion will chill all federal employees due to the illegal and inappropriate haphazard and secretive process OPM has used for this rule and many other decisions in the past few months. Besides impacting ALL current federal employees, the prospect of at-will dismissal will deter talented individuals from public service, increase turnover, and erode institutional expertise. Numerous studies—including those from Berkeley Haas and the Brookings Institution (https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/research/study-finds-the-cost-of-partisanship-among-federal-workers and https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-risks-of-schedule-f-for-administrative-capacity-and-government-accountability/) document the high costs of politicization and instability in federal employment. OPM must conduct and publish a peer-reviewed impact study before proceeding (Section II.C).

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

The proposed rules change regarding procedures for taking action against civil servants is alarming. These changes are being proposed to make it easier to fire employees without cause and due process. Reclassifying a broad category of federal employees is a smokescreen for being able to fire employees for political reasons, not for &quot;accountability&quot; or &quot;responsiveness.&quot;

Competent and responsible government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens. Firing 50,000 federal employees will tragically wound the trust that Americans have in their federal government. The vast majority of these employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day, with little acclaim and low pay. For example, people near retirement age, like me, would like to know that workers in the Social Security Administration are experienced and qualified and able to help us navigate the system with competence.

This rules change seems like an attempt to permanently cripple the American government, which, despite its many flaws, has served this country admirably since the beginning of this country.

I am writing in my personal capacity; all views and positions expressed by me are solely my own and in no way represent the views or position of my employer.



I strongly oppose the implementation of Schedule F. Civil service protections exist to ensure federal employees can perform their duties free from political influence or retaliation. This proposed rule risks compromising our public institutions&#x27; neutrality, expertise, and effectiveness by allowing positions to be filled based on political affiliation rather than professional qualifications or scientific expertise.



Currently, based on 42 U.S.C. 284, the Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is the only political appointee at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Expanding political appointments to include all NIH Institute and Center Directors and potentially division directors would drastically politicize these critical roles. Such a change would increase turnover, disrupt long-term strategic planning, and significantly hinder the agency&#x27;s ability to execute its mission effectively.

After reading many detailed legal analyses of this regulation I find cause to be concerned that it will not accomplish its goal and should therefore be stricken down. The proposed regulation, which would create a new “Schedule Policy/Career” classification within the excepted service, directly contradicts the foundational principles of a merit-based civil service. It would allow thousands of career federal employees, those labeled as “policy-influencing”, to be stripped of the rights and protections afforded under
Title 5 of the U.S. Code. These individuals could be terminated without cause, without notice, and without recourse, removing the procedural safeguards that have long protected the integrity of our nonpartisan civil service. 
Corruption is a serious problem in every administration worldwide and this regulation, in failing to protect civil servants from being targeted for their views, creates an open season for mass purges of people of different poltical backgrounds. Our civil servants should not have to give up participating in democracy and politics outside their workspace - as is their right!! - in order to serve the American people.

              title="To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposal to reintroduce Schedule F and politicize the federal civil service. This plan presents serious risks to the integrity, efficiency, and trustworthiness of our government for the following reasons:

1. It Undermines a Merit-Based System.
The U.S. civil service was established to ensure that positions are filled based on qualifications and merit—not political loyalty. Reclassifying tens of thousands of career federal employees as “at-will” under Schedule F threatens to dismantle these essential protections, enabling the dismissal of skilled professionals solely for political reasons.

2. It Jeopardizes Government Continuity and Expertise.
Our nation depends on experienced, nonpartisan civil servants to provide continuity and institutional knowledge across administrations. Politicizing these roles risks losing invaluable expertise, which would lead to disruptions in critical government operations.

3. It Opens the Door to Abuse of Power.
Replacing impartial professionals with political loyalists increases the risk of decisions driven by ideology rather than evidence-based policy. This shift dangerously prioritizes political interests over the public good, undermining the foundation of fair governance.

This sort of anecdotal nonsense and the gossip printed in fake news do not substitute for factual data. Where is your evidence?

Stable employment is critical to economic prosperity. At-will employment for Federal workers undermines the GDP for the whole nation.

Stable employment is also critical to national security. It is absurd on the face of it to believe that one single human being can supervise a million people. At-will employment leads to cowardly employees who are unable to lead confidently and independently in times of need.

The federal civil service system , which is based on merit, was established by The Pendleton Act ( Act) of 1863. This Act was in response to the ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of the “Spoils System “ in which federal employment was based upon political loyalties or personal relationships. Career Civil Servants were further protected by enactment of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, which stated that removal actions must be for merit-based reasons and not inappropriate causes, such as whistleblowing. Furthermore, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the concerns that the merit-based civil service rules impeded agencies’ abilities to effectively manage employees and remove poor performance were addressed. 
This proposed Regulation is simply a ploy to return to the “Spoils System “ , while cloaking it under the guise of a false “good government “ argument.  The regulation will inflict significant harm on the professionalism of the federal workforce and the critically important institutional knowledge of federal agencies handling complex issues related to public health and safety and effective government operations.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

1. Politicization of the Civil Service:
The proposed rule appears to resurrect and expand concepts from the previously rescinded &quot;Schedule F&quot; Executive Order, enabling broad reclassification of career civil servants into categories that would strip them of long-established merit system protections. This shift opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing, undermining the neutrality of the federal workforce and threatening the continuity and institutional knowledge necessary for good governance.

2. Erosion of Merit Principles and Due Process:
Federal employees are selected and retained based on merit to ensure they serve the public impartially. By making it easier to remove employees outside traditional due process protections, the rule weakens vital safeguards against political retaliation, favoritism, and cronyism. Due process rights are not obstacles but essential components of an accountable and fair government.

              title="After nearly twenty years of dedicated federal service, spanning multiple career fields, I wish to express my strong opposition to the “Schedule Policy/Career” proposal (formerly known as Schedule F). My perspective reflects firsthand knowledge of how merit protections preserve agency effectiveness, safeguard impartial expertise, and uphold public trust.

1. Preservation of the Merit System
The merit-based civil service was deliberately designed to insulate technical experts, analysts, attorneys, and career managers from political influence. By reclassifying thousands of policy‐influencing roles into an at-will framework, the proposed rule dismantles due-process rights—removal and suspension protections, MSPB appeals, and veterans’ preference—undermining statutory mandates in the Pendleton Act and Civil Service Reform Act. Career professionals must be free to render objective, fact-based advice without fear of reprisal; this proposal shifts incentives toward political loyalty rather than competence.

2. Chilling Effect on Expertise and Candor
Under an at-will regime, seasoned professionals will self‐censor or leave public service entirely. I have witnessed colleagues hesitate before voicing concerns on draft regulations or risk assessments, mindful that “policy-making” duties could trigger reclassification. This atmosphere stifles rigorous peer review, weakens legal and scientific analyses, and deprives agencies of honest appraisals—exactly when independent judgment is most c...

The oath to protect and serve the Constitution and protect the people’s trust without regard to political views (my own or others) was the highest calling of my career. 
To consider that federal employees would revert to the cronyism and mob boss systems that existed before the modern civil service structures were implemented is extremely concerning to me.
Civil servants often forego higher salaries they could earn in the private sector, and we as a society have determined that earned benefits such as pension, health insurance, and paid leave serve to partially compensate for the lower pay structures that government employment provides.
These decisions were made after extensive hearings, public comment periods, and coverage in the national press. None of that has happened with Schedule F, either time it has been proposed by the current President. Please do not proceed with the politicization of the public workforce.">As a retired rural carrier for 29 years, I touched people’s most precious documents and had unlimited access to their most sensitive information.

For too long, unelected career bureaucrats in the federal government have stifled efficiency by undermining the plans and policies of the Chief Executive.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.

              title="As a physician-scientist specializing in multiple sclerosis (MS), I am deeply concerned about the implications of the proposed Schedule F rule for the scientific integrity and stability of federal grantmaking, particularly at the NIH. The proposal to reclassify leadership roles and individuals involved in grant evaluation as “policymaking positions” threatens to inject political influence into processes that must remain grounded in scientific merit and peer review.

The progress we have made in understanding and treating MS, including advances in imaging biomarkers and precision therapeutics, has been possible through long-term, sustained investment by NIH and other agencies committed to scientific rigor. Reclassifying these roles as political appointments would undermine continuity, discourage expert leadership, and erode public trust in the objectivity of federal funding decisions.

Scientific grantmaking is not a political activity. It is a process that requires technical expertise, independence, and a commitment to evidence-based decision-making. Undermining these principles will not only threaten the research pipeline but will ultimately harm patients who rely on federally funded innovation to improve health outcomes.

I urge OPM to withdraw this proposal and preserve the apolitical, expert-driven structure that ensures the integrity of our nation’s scientific enterprise.

Part of what makes these services good is that they are provided to all, regardless of whom we voted for, and they are provided by qualified, experienced, and in many cases highly educated, public servants who are dedicated to the public good. They go through rigorous non-discriminatory hiring processes based on merit and qualifications, not based on their loyalty to a specific political party. This is directly related to the relatively low levels of corruption and high levels of service that they provide. 

I have traveled and studied in Central America and seen firsthand the degradation of public services and low morale in communities in which public jobs are controlled by the political party in power and given out to their cronies without regard to qualifications. Inevitably, quality goes down and community suffers. Even rich people are inconvenienced when the water or electricity are turned off because someone has stolen the funds that were supposed to be used for improvements and maintenance. Without non-partisanship it is hard to have true accountability, and corruption and favoritism are inevitable. For these reasons and many more, I urge you to not alter schedu...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Comment Opposing the Implementation of Schedule F as Described in FR 2025-04-23


I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed regulation establishing Schedule F, which would reclassify thousands of federal positions—including many that directly influence scientific research and grantmaking—as “policymaking” roles subject to political appointment and removal.


This proposal threatens to undermine the core principle that federal science policy and funding decisions should be driven by expertise, evidence, and long-term public interest—not by political ideology. The proposed language explicitly includes positions with &quot;substantive discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,&quot; encompassing individuals responsible for drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating scientific grant proposals, and selecting recipients. These activities demand scientific independence, peer-reviewed rigor, and continuity—not political loyalty.


If implemented as described, this regulation would allow future administrations to politicize major agencies such as the NIH by turning key leadership positions—including Institute and Center Directors and Division Directors—into political appointments. This would significantly erode the independence and integrity of federal science agencies and introduce high levels of turnover that are incompatible with the long-range planning and program stability essential to scientific progress and public health.

Scientific progress and sound public policy depend on the stability, independence, and professionalism of the federal workforce. Schedule F poses a direct threat to these principles by enabling the politicization of policy-influencing positions within the government. Removing civil service protections from scientific and technical staff in policy roles creates an environment where decisions may be driven not by evidence, but by political expediency or ideology.

The hallmark of a functioning democracy is a government that protects the free flow of scientific data and objective analysis, regardless of who is in office. Schedule F risks silencing expert voices, discouraging whistleblowers, and undermining public trust in government agencies, including those responsible for public health, environmental protection, energy policy, and climate science.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

This rule undermines the core principles of a nonpartisan, professional federal workforce. Our government functions best when experts can provide honest, evidence-based input—without fear of political retaliation. History has shown that Schedule F-style rules are used not to root out poor performance, but to purge those who raise legal, ethical, or factual concerns.

Weaponizing the federal workforce for political gain is dangerous. It threatens the continuity, accountability, and integrity of public service—and puts our democracy at risk.

Maintaining consistency in leadership and minimizing turnover in key government positions is critical to the effective functioning of our institutions. The proposed policy would significantly impact the employment of personnel across various agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), resulting in increased turnover that would disrupt agency operations. This instability would directly affect which studies receive funding and how research is conducted, ultimately jeopardizing the progress of scientific research and innovation.

Science should not be subject to political influence, yet policies like this risk undermining critical scientific advancements—particularly under the current administration. Groundbreaking research often takes years to come to fruition. Undermining the stability of institutions like the NIH by politicizing appointments would severely hinder that progress.

Civil service protections have long ensured that non-partisan professionals can serve the public interest without fear of political retaliation. Removing these protections would make it harder to attract and retain highly qualified, impartial experts. Job security should not hinge on political ideologies or changing administrations.

Experience and expertise are essential in guiding evidence-based decisions. This approach opens the door to appointing individuals who may lack the qualifications necessary for such critical roles, and who may ... [truncated]">Re: Docket ID: OPM–2025–0004

The introduction of Schedule Policy/Career (Schedule P/C) employees will bring unnecessary instability into the federal workforce, since the rule strips employees of their civil service protections, designates the President as the ultimate authority in classifying jobs as Schedule P/C, and does not allow for an appeal of that classification. This will harm government agencies, and Americans, the people they exist to serve.

I work at an agency that safeguards mainstream Americans. In addition to the agency’s mission, and my desire to make a positive impact on peoples’ lives, I was drawn to government service for its stability. As a single-income household, the employment stability gained through civil service protections is very important to me. Those same protections also garner stability in the federal workforce more broadly, which ultimately benefits the government and the people they serve. Workers who stay at their agencies longer gain more expertise in complex government operations, and they accumulate institutional knowledge. In addition, the rigorous merit-based government hiring practices also lead to a high quality workforce. In my personal experience, I have found the highest level of qu...

1. I oppose this proposed rule in its entirety, and every section of the proposed rule, as it allows for the reintroduction of a &quot;spoils&quot; system to the federal civil service. The proposed rule allows any given Administration to replace the nation&#x27;s professional cadre of policy experts who serve the Constitution across Administrations with individuals who subordinate their duty to the Constitution and the law to partisan loyalties.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category.

This threatens democracy and undermines the American citizens trust in the U.S. government and government officials, which has already been worn thin. Furthermore, the appointment of these positions by the President of the United States, rather than experts in government organizations, hurts the United States&#x27;s standing as a leader in science and in public health.

Schedule F and Civil Service
I am currently an environmental consultant. I founded Integrated Lakes Management, an environmental  firm that has been operating for over 30 years.  I have previously worked at Region V USEPA in the Water Division.
It is my understanding that Schedule F is “… a job classification for appointments in the excepted service of the United States federal civil service for permanent policy-related positions”. It has a history dating back to the first Trump administration and it’s ostensible goal is “…to improve performance, management and accountability.” Supporters of the rule are suggesting that as many as 50,000 career civil servants achieve political appointee status.

I submit this comment in strong opposition to OPM’s proposed rule to establish Schedule Policy/Career. Under the guise of promoting a nonpartisan workforce, the proposed rule would do precisely the opposite, allowing the President to reclassify tens or even hundreds of thousands of civil servants as at-will employees who could be fired for perceived partisan behavior. 

While I submit this comment in my personal capacity, I have over a decade of experience working as a civil law enforcement attorney in the federal government. A core part of my job has been to provide advice on legal matters involving Congressionally-enacted consumer protection laws. I have always felt free to provide independent opinions, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, without concern that I could be punished for simply doing my job. This has remained true regardless of the political salience of the work I’ve done, or whether my feedback happens to align with the current leadership’s agenda.

The proposed rule would change that: a good-faith disagreement with agency leadership could be viewed as partisan, and therefore grounds for termination. This result would be awful for civil servants, who would face constant pressure to soften, or even alter, critical feedback.

Now, Project 2025&quot;, Trump’s far-right playbook—promises to finish the job by dismantling every check on his power. Here’s the horrifying record:  

1. COVID’s Mass Death Toll: A Direct Result of Trump’s Sabotage
&quot;Firing the Pandemic Response Team (2018)&quot;: Trump &quot;disbanded the CDC’s Global Health Security team&quot; in 2018, leaving the U.S. unprepared for COVID. When the virus hit, &quot;testing collapsed&quot;, PPE vanished, and &quot;states competed for supplies like a Third World country&quot;.  
- Silencing Scientists: Trump &quot;blocked CDC warnings&quot;, pressured the FDA to approve unsafe treatments, and &quot;retaliated against whistleblowers&quot; like Dr. Rick Bright (who warned of ventilator shortages).  
- The Human Cost: By the end of Trump’s term, &quot;over 400,000 Americans were dead&quot;—many in &quot;preventable outbreaks&quot; (e.g., &quot;nursing home massacres&quot; after Trump’s CDC &quot;weakened protections&quot;). Studies show &quot;at least 40% of U.S. COVID deaths&quot; could have been avoided with competent leadership.  

Project 2025’s Malice (p. 545):  
&quot;The new administration must purge the CDC and FDA of employees who resist political directives… and restructure these agencies to prioritize ‘alignment’ over ‘so-called science.’”

I was born in a country where who you knew mattered more than what you knew—where family connections, personal loyalty, and political obedience determined whether you got a job, kept your job, or had any rights at all.

I became a U.S. citizen by choice because I believed in something better. I believed in a government of laws, not men. I believed in institutions that are accountable to the people, not to one leader. And I believed in the importance of a professional, nonpartisan civil service—where individuals are hired based on merit and can speak the truth without fear.

That is why this proposed “Schedule Career/Policy” rule horrifies me. I have lived through what happens when loyalty becomes more important than law. I have seen good, competent people fired, silenced, or exiled because they refused to play along with corruption or cover up the truth. I have seen what happens when everyone in government is afraid to speak up—because they know that the moment they do, they’ll be replaced by someone more “loyal.”

This rule brings that same sickness to the American civil service.

It would give political appointees the power to label career employees as “policy-related” and remove them with no due process. The definition is vague enough to apply to thousands of people—including scientists, attorneys, public health professionals, e...

I strongly oppose the proposed rule that would pave the way for the reinstatement of Schedule F or similar policies. This change threatens the core of a professional, nonpartisan civil service by allowing broad reclassification of career federal employees into roles that could be filled or vacated at will.

Such a system would strip critical job protections from potentially tens of thousands of federal workers, turning positions based on merit into political appointments. It undermines the long-standing principle that civil servants serve the public—not political leaders—and creates the potential for sweeping purges of qualified, experienced staff based solely on political considerations.

The damage wouldn&#x27;t end with job loss. The chilling effect of such uncertainty would drive talent away from public service, eroding expertise and institutional memory across agencies. This weakens the government&#x27;s ability to function effectively and impartially, especially in times of crisis.

I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and protect the integrity, professionalism, and independence of the federal civil service.">Comment on Proposed Rule OPM-2025-0004

              title="Subject: Public Comment Opposing OPM Proposed Rule 2025-004


I write to express deep concern regarding OPM’s proposed rule (OPM-2025-004), which purports to enhance accountability within the civil service by creating a new employment category for certain policy-influencing roles. While accountability is an important goal, this rule risks politicizing the civil service and weakening the foundations of impartial governance that have served our democracy for over a century.

1. Threat to Civil Service Neutrality:
The rule creates ambiguity around what constitutes a “policy-influencing” position, and opens the door to discretionary and potentially politically motivated removals. This fundamentally undermines the principle of a nonpartisan civil service. Career federal employees must be able to offer honest, evidence-based guidance to leadership—regardless of political climate—without fear of reprisal.

2. Chilling Effect on Public Servants:
The prospect of being removed for subjective or ideologically driven reasons may deter federal employees from providing critical but politically inconvenient information. This chilling effect degrades policy-making and weakens government oversight functions.

3. Risk to Institutional Knowledge and Continuity:
Federal employees in policy-advisory roles often possess years—sometimes decades—of institutional knowledge. Sweeping removals in these roles threaten the long-term effectiveness of agencies, especially in complex fields like national se...

              title="&quot;I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.
First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.
Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

This change will add further politicization to a system already burdened by a public with deep divisions, and mistrust for government.

By allowing policy-influencing positions to be moved into Schedule Policy/Career and making them at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals, this rule undermines the nonpartisan nature of these roles.

It opens the door to potential misuse of power, where employees could be removed based on political motivations rather than performance or misconduct.

Such a change risks turning the federal workforce into a tool for political agendas, rather than a body dedicated to serving the public interest.

It is crucial to maintain the independence and objectivity of federal employees to ensure that they can perform their duties without fear of unjust removal or retaliation.

For these reasons, I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reconsider this proposed rule change and prioritize the preservation of a nonpartisan, merit-based federal workforce.">I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule change outlined in the document &quot;Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.&quot; This rule change poses a significant threat to the integrity and impartiality of the federal workforce.

Unlike political appointees who typically serve at the pleasure of an administration and are expected to advance its agenda, civil servants are career employees hired through a merit-based system to ensure stable, nonpartisan implementation of laws and policies. Historically, civil servants have always performed their duties regardless of what administration was in the White House, demonstrating their commitment to upholding the Constitution and serving the public interest. This distinction safeguards the integrity and effectiveness of government operations by insulating essential functions from political interference.

Mr. Trump’s Executive Order 14210 did not follow the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) established guidelines and procedures for a Reduction in Force (RIF), as outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 3502. These procedures are designed to provide a fair and equitable process for determining which employees an agency will release, using a formula that considers tenure, preference eligibility, length of service, and performance. Once the scope of a RIF is determined, agencies are required to begin releasing employees from the bottom of the retention list.

Illegal
Schedule Policy/Career directly undermines civil service protections enshrined in U.S. law. The Pendleton Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 were enacted to shield federal employees from political interference and arbitrary dismissal. By reclassifying career positions into Schedule Policy/Career, the government effectively strips employees of due process and merit-based protections. This politicization of the federal workforce violates established statutory principles and could be found unconstitutional for infringing on the legal safeguards that ensure a nonpartisan civil service.

Immoral
The moral foundation of public service lies in impartiality, dedication to the common good, and adherence to the rule of law—not political loyalty. Schedule Policy/Career undermines these principles by turning professional public servants into expendable assets, subject to removal based on political alignment. It penalizes integrity and rewards sycophancy, compromising the ethical fabric of government and violating the public trust.

Impractical

We strongly oppose the Office of Personnel Management&#x27;s (OPM) proposed rule to increase career employee accountability through the introduction of at-will positions within Schedule Policy/Career. While the intention to enhance accountability in federal employment is commendable, the approach outlined in this proposal is fundamentally flawed and poses significant risks to the integrity of our civil service system.

First and foremost, the shift to at-will employment for policy-influencing positions undermines the very principles of fairness and due process that are foundational to our democratic governance. By exempting these positions from adverse action procedures and appeals, the proposal opens the door to arbitrary and capricious dismissals, which can be influenced by political motivations rather than genuine performance issues. This not only jeopardizes the job security of dedicated public servants but also threatens the nonpartisan nature of our federal workforce, which is essential for maintaining public trust in government operations.

Moreover, the assertion that this rule will facilitate the swift removal of employees who engage in misconduct or poor performance is misleading. The existing mechanisms for addressing such issues, while perhaps in need of reform, are designed to ensure that employees are treated fairly and that their rights are protected. The proposed rule, by contrast, risks creat... [truncated]">**Statement Opposing the Proposed OPM Rule on Employee Accountability**

This proposal represents a dangerous move toward politicizing the federal workforce. It would allow for the reclassification of career positions into roles without traditional civil service protections, undermining long-standing merit system principles and threatening the impartiality and integrity of federal agencies.

This rule does not exist in a vacuum. It follows a troubling pattern of workforce disruption, including deferred resignation programs (DRPs), threat of unprecedented reductions in force (RIFs), and efforts to terminate tens of thousands of probationary and term employees. Implementing this rule would further destabilize the federal workforce and serve as another method for the administration to dismantle critical agencies by removing experienced staff, often without just cause and outside the bounds of the law.

Additionally, this proposal poses a grave threat to U.S. research and innovation. Federal agencies such as NIH, NOAA, and NASA are global leaders in science and technology.

I am concerned that the proposed “Schedule Policy/Career” (SP/C) goes too far in allowing nonpartisan policy-involved staff to be dismissed for reasons other than competence and performance. It seems to conflate performance with carrying out policy. This is especially concerning when many of the policies that employees have been asked to carry out are of questionable legality, as has been shown by the many court cases where executive orders have been put on hold or reversed. Under SP/C, it seems that federal employees would be unprotected even if they had legitimate concerns about the legality of an order. The loyalty that federal employees should evince is towards their oath to uphold the Constitution, not to any specific administration.">I am a former Foreign Service officer and have worked in my current organization with many federal employees (mostly at Transportation and DHS).

Hiring political appointees to run the NSF would kill the NSF as surely as hiring political appointees to run a restaurant would kill the restaurant. Obviously, a scientific institution needs to be run by scientists, just as a restaurant needs to be run by chefs. I don&#x27;t think anyone is fooled into thinking that this proposed rule would improve the NSF. Rather, it is clearly part of an attempt to destroy American science for being an independent source of truth.  America&#x27;s strength in science, built and funded carefully over decades, is a source of American power in so many ways. We cannot allow its destruction.">I earned an National Science Foundation Graduate Student Fellowship when I was doing my PhD research in the late 90s/early 2000s at MIT, and, in part because of this financial support, I have gone on to a successful scientific career.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category.

By getting rid of the appeals process, these employees will have no guarantee of due process if their supervisor terminates their employment for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct, so even though this rule states that these positions will be &quot;filled based on merit and not political affiliation&quot;, without due process for dismissal there will be no check on whether this is actually happening. If these employees can be removed at any time, for any reason, their focus will naturally shift to making their supervisors happy instead of on doing their job to the best of their abilities.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

I am writing in my personal capacity as a US citizen to express my concerns about the proposed rule, “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” The preamble, in its example of Department of Justice (DOJ) personnel refusing to bring a lawsuit against Yale University for its affirmative action policies, implies that positions of a “confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character” subject to at-will employment include attorneys who litigate on behalf of the executive. Executive branch attorneys’ adherence to the law as interpreted by the courts rather than as interpreted by political appointees is fundamental to our founding principle, “A nation of laws, not of men.” All US citizens, including myself, whose views may differ the current or future presidential administration, are potentially subject to a chilling effect should this proposed rule go into effect with the interpretation implied in the preamble. 
	The preamble, by using DOJ career attorneys’ refusal to bring litigation against Yale as an example, implies that they would be covered by Schedule F’s at-will employment.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Further, Schedule F&#x27;s vague criteria makes an open door for violations of 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Employees without these protections are likely to work with reduced accountability and safety (for fear of speaking up) as well as reduced productivity, as people with ideas for improvement will be disinclined to speak up... like this will, at the very least, destroy any sort of productive work culture.

Scientific integrity requires insulation from political whims, ensuring that experts can follow data, not directives.

Protecting technical professionals is not about bureaucracy but about ensuring sound policy, based on fact, not politics.
I urge OPM to reconsider provisions that jeopardize scientific independence and instead strengthen protections for technical expertise in public service.

I am worried about signing my name publicly because of this absurd political climate. This rule will make this climate worse.">While the intent may be improving government accountability, the proposed rule will fail to shield career scientists and other technical experts from political and ideological pressures. Federal agencies rely on independent, evidence-based expertise in fields like public health and climate science. ...</span>

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

This designation misrepresents the essential, nonpartisan work performed by these civil servants and could have far-reaching negative consequences for government accountability, efficiency, and integrity.

Grant administrators do not set policy. Their work — drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating applications, and recommending awards — is guided by laws, regulations, and agency-established criteria. These roles are technical and compliance-based, not political or discretionary in the policymaking sense. To reiterate, these employees do not exercise independent authority to change the objectives or structure of grant programs; instead, they implement decisions already made by Congress or agency leadership.

Reclassifying these positions would:
	•	Politicize grant funding, allowing partisan appointees to direct resources based on loyalty or ideology rather than merit, which contradicts the goal of draining the swamp.
	•	Undermine government efficiency, as politically appointed individuals may lack the technical expertise to manage complex grant programs, delaying funding and disrupting essential services.

              title="Hello,
I am writing to express my disagreement with the proposed policy. This proposal could result in currently non-political scientific directors at NIH and NSF becoming political appointees. Political interference with grants assessment is in complete defiance of the basic principles of science, most notably impartiality and non-bias. The people who overlook and assess grants should reflect those same principles; it should not be reflective of the whims or ideologies of whatever the current administration and/or political climate is at the moment. If political interference over grants occurs, then the United States science and technology sector will face the same detrimental consequences that China&#x27;s did during their Cultural Revolution in the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s. Specifically, there will be disastrous spread of anti-intellectualism and repression, adverse disruption of education and research all across the country (not just among elite universities), and a severe loss of talent and expertise which other sectors are greatly reliant on. Worst of all, non-scientists in the U.S. will also face severe consequences as a result, and perhaps face repression as well. Finally, it will set the United States&#x27; intellectual and technological global status back severely, which may never be able to be recuperated, or to catch up with the technological growth of other nations.
I sincerely hope that my reasoning as listed above would be considered when considering this action.">Hello,

This proposal would strike at the heart of the merit‐based civil service system that has ensured a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce since the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883. The proposed regulation OPM-2025-0004 seeks to reclassify certain federal positions into the new “Schedule Policy/Career” category. This change would strip civil service protections from approximately 50,000 federal employees, making them at-will and vulnerable to dismissal without the standard due process. Such a move threatens the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce, opening the door to politicization and undermining the nonpartisan execution of government functions.

By removing established safeguards, the regulation risks creating an environment where career professionals can be terminated for political reasons, rather than for legitimate performance issues. This not only jeopardizes the impartiality of federal agencies but also deters qualified individuals from public service due to job insecurity. The proposed rule’s potential to erode institutional knowledge and expertise could lead to inefficiencies and a decline in the quality of public services. would undermine institutional knowledge and discourage top-flight professionals from entering or remaining in public service.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

              title="Dear Office of Personnel Management,

I am writing to express my concern about the proposed rule aimed at increasing accountability for career federal employees. While I support the idea of improving performance and ensuring public trust, I fear this rule could inadvertently politicize roles that are meant to remain nonpartisan.

Accountability is important, but this approach risks undermining the professional independence of
civil servants. Instead of restructuring the nature of these positions, I would encourage a focus on well-
designed performance metrics that reflect how each role contributes to the public good. Since federal
positions vary widely across departments, any evaluation system should be tailored to the unique duties and impact of each role.

The summary of the rule states that these positions will remain “career jobs filled on a nonpartisan
basis,” yet it also raises concerns about “subverting Presidential directives.” This seems contradictory.
It implies a shift toward requiring political loyalty, which could erode trust in the neutrality of the civil service.

A strong, apolitical civil service is vital for reducing polarization and maintaining institutional
stability. As a registered voter in Florida, I will be keeping this issue in mind in upcoming elections,
including the midterms.

Thank you for your continued service. I recognize the important and often underappreciated role this
office plays in maintaining a fair and functional government. I do not su... [truncated]">Dear Office of Personnel Management,

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

The Honorable [Representative/Senator Name]




I am writing to express my strong opposition to any efforts to reinstate or expand Schedule F or similar measures that would undermine the merit-based civil service protections for federal employees. These protections are essential to maintaining a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce that serves the public interest over political agendas.

Schedule F, initially introduced via Executive Order in 2020, sought to reclassify a broad range of career federal employees into a new category exempt from longstanding civil service rules, effectively making them at-will employees. This action threatened to politicize the federal workforce by removing due process protections and opening the door for the dismissal of skilled public servants based on political considerations rather than performance or conduct.

The U.S. civil service was designed to ensure continuity, integrity, and impartiality in government operations, regardless of political transitions. Weakening these foundations jeopardizes not only the stability of federal institutions but also public trust in government. Professionals across agencies — from scient... [truncated]">ChatGPT

I oppose the proposed extension of the exception to federal competitive hiring rules to career professionals across the federal government. Career civil service employees play a critical role in the operation of the federal government, keeping each agency functioning across administrations and during times of transition. These workers carry out the day-to-day operations of the federal government in positions that transcend politics. This proposed rule would broaden the permissible reasons to dismiss career employees and allow the President to install replacements based on political ideology. To amend career employees’ hiring status is to politicize the apolitical. In effect, the current approach to employee classification insulates the federal government from drastic changes in policy application from administration to administration. This allows agencies to interact with citizens consistently and effectively, without needing to implement entirely new approaches every four years. Institutional knowledge is essential to complex organizations like federal agencies, and the only way to have strong institutional knowledge is by maintaining a core team of dedicated career public servants. Under the proposed rule, employees whose political values do not align with the current administration’s will be more easily dismissed, and politically similar replacements may be i...

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reject this rule and protect the integrity of the merit...

It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees’ constitutional and statutory rights.

Specific concerns are presented below.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

This very &quot;interesting&quot; regulatory proposal certainly violates the provisions of 5 USC chapters 43, 53 and 75, and the minimum due process requirements of the 5th Amendment of the US Constitution.  The proposed regulations would separate career competitive service and excepted service employees involuntarily from their statutorily and Constitutionally appointed positions and place them into a new, to-be-created created classification system that lacks the procedural and substantive rights of their former positions, without following the above statutory authorities and procedures.  Also, OPM&#x27;s proposed regulations do not afford Constitutionally required &quot;minimum due process&quot; (i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to be heard by a neutral informed decision maker who has the authority to reach a binding different conclusion than that mandated by the proposed regulations) under the 5th Amendment.  That is the right of all career federal employees by the decisions of the US Courts, before they may be separated involuntarily from their positi...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

For too long, unelected career bureaucrats in the federal government have stifled efficiency by undermining the plans and policies of the Chief Executive.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.


I support President Trump’s work to rein in unaccountable bureaucrats and end the Deep State!">I support President Trump’s efforts to bring accountability to the federal bureaucracy. 


For too long, unelected career bureaucrats in the federal government have stifled efficiency by undermining the plans and policies of the Chief Executive.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

The proposed changes could erode job protections for federal employees, making them more vulnerable to political influence, arbitrary dismissal, and retaliation. This threatens not only the morale and independence of the civil workforce but also the quality and consistency of government services to the public. Career civil servants are essential for ensuring continuity, institutional knowledge, and impartial implementation of policy across administrations.

Furthermore, the order appears to prioritize expedience over fairness, placing disproportionate emphasis on punitive measures rather than investing in training, support, and systemic improvements.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Presidents are democratically elected, not flawless. The people expect longstanding government rules to act as a guardrail and/or safety net for each administration.

Scientists, for instance, cannot report false results just because they align with the president&#x27;s interests.  To do so would violate their primary job description.

In short, what happens when the president directs a civil servant to commit misconduct or to perform poorly? The request will put the civil servant in a no-win situation.

I write to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule on “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” Despite its name, this proposal effectively revives the harmful “Schedule F” initiative under a new label—Schedule Policy/Career (P/C)—posing serious risks to the integrity and stability of the federal workforce.

Allowing widespread reclassification of civil servants into at-will roles strips them of essential due process protections, undermines whistleblower safeguards, and opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This would not only erode the merit-based principles of the civil service but also inject instability, inefficiency, and potential waste across federal agencies—costs that taxpayers would ultimately bear.

From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, the lack of any cost analysis is especially troubling. The rule anticipates massive workforce turnover with each new administration, yet fails to account for the logistical and financial burden of recruiting and onboarding thousands of new personnel. Such disruption threatens oversight, program continuity, and the government’s ability to manage public funds effectively.

Instead of politicizing the workforce, reforms should focus on modernizing hiring practices, addressing skill gaps, and strengthening accountability through performance-based systems—not by dismantling merit protections. I urge OPM to w... [truncated]">Dear Acting Director Ezell,

Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

To the Office of Personnel Management:

The proposed rule to establish “Schedule Policy/Career” is a fundamental departure from the spirit and purpose of the U.S. civil service. It is historically revisionist, legally flawed, and normatively corrosive to democratic accountability.

I. Foundational Mischaracterization of Civil Service Origins

The framing offered in OPM’s background section presents a misleading view of the historical trajectory of the federal workforce. While it is true that early federal employment was politicized, the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883 represented not a reluctant or temporary compromise, but an intentional pivot toward institutionalized merit, driven by public outrage over abuses.

Rather than reinforcing executive control, the history of civil service reform—from Pendleton to McKinley’s EO 101 and Roosevelt’s EO 173—demonstrates a steady progression away from arbitrary removals and toward transparency, procedural fairness, and professional standards. The emphasis was always on building a capable, impartial, and resilient public workforce, not clearing bureaucratic space for political retaliation.

OPM’s interpretation of these developments as evidence of tolerance for at-will removal lacks support from the actual legislative and executive rationale of the era.

              title="Schedule Policy/Career: An Assault on Expertise, Integrity, and Democratic Governance
Overview
The implementation of Schedule Policy/Career, or Schedule F, by the current administration represents a dangerous and regressive step in federal workforce policy. It enables the removal of career civil servants without due process, particularly those involved in policy formulation. This is not simply a restructuring—it is a calculated effort to purge expertise, suppress dissent, and consolidate power by targeting those who best understand the workings of government.

Firing the Capable and Informed
At the heart of this policy is a deeply troubling trend: the removal of smart, capable, and experienced professionals. These individuals are not political appointees; they are career public servants whose loyalty lies with the law, the Constitution, and the American public. They possess the institutional knowledge needed to develop sound policies, advise leadership, and maintain operational continuity. Eliminating them not only creates a vacuum in competence but signals that knowledge and experience are liabilities in public service.

Targeting Policy Experts
The administration&#x27;s focus on employees involved in policy roles raises serious questions about its motivations. Why target those who craft, analyze, and implement public policy? The answer appears to be political control. These employees are often the ones who provide honest assessments, warn against legal or practical pitfalls, and...

The text of the propose rule contains a good argument against the adoption of the rule:

&quot;The adverse action procedures and appeals that make it difficult for agency leadership to hold employees accountable also empower career employees to insert partisan or personal preferences into their official duties.

The propose rule says itself that most federal employees faithfully perform their jobs. So what is broken here that needs fixing?

The fact that civil service jobs cannot be terminated except for poor performance or malfeasance makes them appealing to people who want to build a career and keep their eyes on the long term.  It also simplifies planning for new projects. If an agency can count on most of their current staff being available in the future, they can plan their projects with more confidence in what kind of staff is already available and what kind they will need to add. Also, the out-of-pocket costs of hiring and training new staff are high.  Without existing staff in place, the new folks will be slower to start being productive.  Thinking of agencies with public facing functions, such as Social Security, we all know from experience that when large groups of new staff provide services, the service levels decline and more mistakes are made. The blending of tenured and new staff is most effective when adopting new processes to perform ongoing activities.

While hiring and firing processes in government jobs could probably use a update, alienating prospective employees and experienced staff is not the way to do it.">This change will make it harder to recruit new staff.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposed change to the regulatory structure for federal employees should be abandoned. I object to these proposed changes. Here is why.
1.	This proposed rule would crush and undermine the “civil service” and lower public confidence in the Executive Branch

The proposal would categorize numerous existing employee positions as “Schedule Policy/Career,” formerly referred to as “Schedule F.” As proposed, any such employee would be subject to immediate dismissal for not sufficiently adhering to existing Administration policies even if such policies are unlawful or ill-advised. When hired, federal employees swear an oath to the U.S. Constitution, not to an Administration or any individual within an Administration. This civil service system was created in 1883 to avoid what had been an Executive Branch “spoils” system of hired sycophants loyal to the Administration that lacked sufficient skill to effectively carry out Executive Branch duties. In contrast, the current federal civil service is a merit-based workforce that follows laws under the U.S. Constitution.

Federal employees develop highly regarded skills and expertise precisely because they are career employees, with many serving the public for 30 or more years. Firing “Schedule Policy/Career” employees will have the effect of in...

This policy would result in a never before seen politicization of a previously nonpartisan, professional workforce. Creating an avenue for replacing nonpartisan career federal employees with political appointees will degrade the integrity of the federal workforce and reduce its capacity to handle the many tasks that it manages every day.

This ruling is clearly not about removing poor performers. There are a great many ways that the process for removing under-performing employees could be improved, and many federal workers would support a reasonable approach to doing so. A sweeping ruling such as this which functionally allows for arbitrary removal of a federal worker in favor of a political appointee is not in the best interest of the American public, and is not the appropriate way to streamline the federal workforce.

Reintroducing Schedule F would undermine performance and accountability in the federal workforce by allowing for the removal of nonpartisan professionals based on perceived political loyalty rather than their objective qualifications or performance. This would eliminate or suppress appropriately informed decision-making, and will deteriorate trust in our public institutions. I strongly urge you to reject this rule and defend the integrity of the federal workforce.">As a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose the proposed rule.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

I oppose the changes proposed in Docket OPM-2025-0004. The Federal Civil Service must remain apolitical in order to serve the public without bias. This rule change would give the President too much power to affect policy, which in our Constitutional system is determined by Congress, not the executive branch.

Furthermore, the proposed rule change is simply too vague to be practical. Relatively low-level employees should not have to decide whether their duties comport with &quot;Presidential directives&quot;. The responsibility for agency actions should lie with agency leadership, which by and large already is made up of presidential appointees.

This policy threatens the integrity of our nonpartisan civil service, a cornerstone of effective and impartial governance. The Schedule PC rule would reclassify certain federal positions, removing established civil service protections and making it easier to dismiss employees based on political considerations rather than merit. This shift undermines the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to eliminate patronage and ensure that federal employment is based on qualifications and not political affiliation. This rule could politicize the federal workforce, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, and making it more difficult to recruit and retain qualified personnel. I believe that this rule would be contrary to congressional intent, would undermine the merit-based civil service system, and would cause citizens to question whether they were being served or not served based on political backgrounds.

              title="I express my unequivocal opposition to the implementation or reinstatement of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal fundamentally threatens the merit-based civil service framework that has upheld a competent, apolitical federal workforce for over a century.

The establishment of Schedule F directly contravenes the principles of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to dismantle the spoils system and ensure that federal employment is determined by merit rather than political loyalty. By enabling the reclassification and potential at-will dismissal of a broad category of career civil servants—particularly those engaged in policy formulation and analysis—Schedule F paves the way for politically motivated employment practices. Such an approach is in direct conflict with 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that all federal employment decisions be merit-based and shielded from political interference.

Furthermore, the overly expansive and ill-defined criteria for inclusion under Schedule F infringe upon the due process rights guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513. This statute requires just cause and procedural protections for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of these protections would not only erode transparency and accountability within the executive branch, but also suppress dissenting expert opinions—thereby weakening the federal government’s capacity to make sound, evidence-based decisions.

The O... [truncated]">I express my unequivocal opposition to the implementation or reinstatement of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal fundamentally threatens the merit-based civil service framework that has upheld a competent, apolitical federal workforce for over a century.

Studies clearly demonstrate that politicization of public services worsens outcomes, reduces transparency, and increases inefficiency - precisely the opposite of what good governance requires.

Our scientific agencies like NIH and NSF have been global leaders precisely because they operate on the basis of scientific merit and expertise, not political expediency. The definition of &quot;policy-making&quot; positions in this proposal is deliberately expansive, capturing program officers and directors who make critical funding decisions based on scientific consensus and peer review. Recent events at these agencies provide a disturbing preview of politicized science: expert-recommended funding decisions reversed by non-scientists, communication with scientific communities restricted, and procedural obstacles created to impede the flow of research funding. This approach threatens America&#x27;s scientific leadership and innovation ecosystem.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

It is a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress expressly rejected 142 years ago. 

Staff of the federal agencies secure the nation, safeguard the public health, promote economic growth and protect consumers from fraud. Their jobs require training and expertise in their chosen field so as to provide the best possible service to all Americans, not passing a political loyalty test.

The Office of Personnel Management established additional safeguards for employees in the event of an executive action like this and those regulations became final in May 2024.  This order has no right to circumvent these regulations.

Civil servants should be focused on their tasks to deliver for the American people and must be protected from arbitrary replacement based on political ideologies, and the corruption that can result from reclassifying them in the same category as political appointees.  The expertise of career civil servants has value and the regulations protecting their employment must not be stripped away to make places for political loyalists who may lack the same expertise and experience of the staff they replace.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

I am submitting these comments regarding the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). As a federal employee writing in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose this Proposed Rule.

The order emphasizes that patronage remains prohibited by defining Schedule Policy/Career to only cover “career positions”. While you can say anything on paper, if an employee does not have the right to appeal the transfer of their position to Schedule P/C or termination, there is no meaningful safeguard against the purported prohibition. If a personnel action was taken against a civil servant because of their perceived loyalty to the current or any future president, that employee would have no recourse to challenge that decision, and the American public would suffer because a competent federal employee was fired for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct. At the agency I work for, interdisciplinary teams of biologists, range specialists, archaeologists, and petroleum engineers apply their expert knowledge of their specialties and the law to conduct environmental reviews and come up with mitigation strategies to ensure that projects on public lands are done in accordance with the law and scientific best practices.

The proposed rule would instead severely undermine the career civil service that Congress has sought to protect and preserve for more than 140 years, beginning with the Pendleton Act of 1883 and as reaffirmed through the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and subsequent amendments. It is akin to businesses who label positions as management when in fact they are just minimally paid employees with no management roles. It is critical that employees be loyal to the constitution and protected from swearing loyalty to an individual. When I still worked at SSA and before that HHS, my job was to defend the agency no matter the politics. That is what all employees have done for decades. As an attorney a judge told us we had a a difficult choice if we felt the agency was wrong. We could risk Rule 11 sanctions and perhaps disbarment should we defended a rule that violated the statute or regulation or we quit. Luckily when those issues evolved we had a way to persuade the agency to reconsider the rule and or the decision in the case at issue. We did not fear losing our jobs. By forcing employees to fear their jobs by making all actions more political, rips away the civil service protections that have so benefited the country for over the past 100 years.

              title="Chapter 43 of Title 5 U.S. Code was enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to streamline the process for addressing poor performance. It allows agencies to take performance-based actions without requiring the same procedural rigor as misconduct-based actions under Chapter 75. It includes:

The establishment of critical performance elements and standards;

The requirement of a performance improvement plan (PIP) when deficiencies arise;

The ability to remove or demote an employee after failure to demonstrate acceptable performance during the PIP period.

Rather than dismantle Chapter 43, agencies should be supported in fully utilizing it. OPM has acknowledged in past Government Accountability Office (GAO) and MSPB reviews that federal managers underutilize Chapter 43 tools due to a lack of training, time, and resources—not because of legal barriers. Solutions include:
Mandatory supervisory training on performance management;
Deployment of Human Capital Officers to assist with performance documentation;
Strengthening support systems like Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) to intervene early.

Eliminating procedural rights under the guise of efficiency erodes the very principles Congress aimed to strengthen in the civil service.

Chapter 7511(b)(2) provides that the protections of Chapter 75 do not apply to an employee “whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character by— the President for a position that the President has excepted from the competitive service; the Office of Personnel Management for a position that the Office has excepted from the competitive service; or the President or the head of an agency for a position excepted from the competitive service by statute.”

Apparently recognizing that so-called “Policy/Career” employees must be in the excepted service for this exclusion to apply, but hoping to quell concerns that such employees would not have competitive status (or frankly to create a framework whereby OPM can claim these employees are hired and promoted based on merit, regardless of whether that occurs) OPM seeks to devise a workaround whereby these excepted service employees will have “competitive status.” This constitutes a clear attempt to rewrite the CSRA by regulation, because only employees in the competitive service have competitive status.

Accountability, development, and responsiveness requires a rigorous, well documented, and publicly accessible system. The proposed rule has none of that, it removes what little of that already exists. If you want to improve things, focus on strengthening the new system, not just allowing political leaders to fire whoever they want whenever they want.

It reads &quot; career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis&quot; but how is that possible? And even if they are filled on a nonpartisan basis, they will be able to be fired on a partisan basis. 

It reads &quot;by intentionally subverting Presidential directives&quot; but what rigorous methods do you have to measure this? It&#x27;s one thing if there is a spy in the federal government, or some activist working based on their own beliefs, but with no clarifications in this rule, that phrase could easily be used if someone thinks a federal employee even appears to disagree with the White House.

I oppose this proposed rule in its entirety, and every section of the proposed rule, as it allows for the reintroduction of a &quot;spoils&quot; system to the federal civil service. The proposed rule allows any given Administration to replace the nation&#x27;s professional cadre of policy experts who serve the Constitution across Administrations with individuals who subordinate their duty to the Constitution and the law to partisan loyalties.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category. The removal of such protection violates the Fifth Amendment due process rights of federal civil servants, specifically by removing the employees&#x27; interest in their tenure protections.

Docket No. OPM-2025-0004

I have deep concern about the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule would erode the objectivity that both Republicans and Democrats rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays a critical role in improving the lives of all Americans, and informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could lead to the politicization of the federal statistical workforce. Official federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. Thus, a President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career. Then, for example, Bureau of Labor Statistics’ leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the President’s policy agenda. They might also face pressure to change methodologies or reveal pre-release information. By making it easier to remove employees if a President deter...

              title="#1: Upholding Merit System Principles
Subject: Opposing Schedule F – Threat to Merit-Based Civil Service

I strongly oppose the proposed creation of a new Schedule F classification. This effort is a direct threat to the merit-based principles that have governed the federal civil service for over a century. The U.S. civil service is designed to ensure that government employees are selected and retained based on competence, not political loyalty. Schedule F would open the door to widespread politicization by allowing for the removal of career professionals in policy-adjacent roles without the due process protections currently afforded under Title 5.

Such a change would fundamentally undermine the apolitical nature of the civil service, eroding public trust and government accountability. We must protect career civil servants from arbitrary dismissal rooted in political considerations.

#2: Disruptive to Government Operations
Subject: Opposing Schedule F – Undermines Government Continuity and Performance

The introduction of Schedule F would create instability and unpredictability across federal agencies. Career civil servants provide institutional knowledge, operational continuity, and subject-matter expertise that political appointees rely on to implement the administration&#x27;s policies effectively.

Turning these essential positions into at-will jobs subject to political replacement would disrupt daily operations, hinder long-term planning, and degrade the quality of public ser... [truncated]">#1: Upholding Merit System Principles

My civil service work provided research and analysis to support Army decision making about materiel design, policy, doctrine, personnel selection, or training effectiveness.  My division of analysts and I possessed advanced knowledge and expertise in human performance methodology and measurement, statistics, modeling and simulation, and cost effectiveness.  We were free to customize and conduct studies to fit the problem, select appropriate alternatives for study, and provide data-driven results.  We prided ourselves on objective interpretation.

Implementation of Schedule P/C threatens to damage objective research and analysis in the Department of the Army by selection of loyalists over experts.  In my view, it will have a chilling effect, not only on higher echelons of government but on the analysts’ freedom and obligations to design objective studies and speak freely about what the results mean.  Unfortunately, I believe it will encourage less committed analysts to curry favor with policy makers by delivering “the right answer”.

Government workers, many of whom have served for years, are the heart of institutional knowledge.  They are not the “deep state”; they keep things running smoothly.  They understand their agencies and the details needed to keep them running.  It would be incredibly ignorant and stupid to replace these people with Trump loyalists who know nothing about the institutions they would be working for.  But perhaps that is the point, since Trump seems to be trying to hollow out our government institutions.  This would be one more way he could damage them.

The damages they have already done will cost all of us more than the supposed dollars saved.  This is a very bad joke.">I strongly oppose this change of regulations.

Reclassification: It allows agencies to reclassify career federal employees in policy-influencing roles into the Schedule Policy/Career category.  This is totally wrong and will encourage retaliation. 

Reduced Protections: Employees in this category have fewer employment protections and are more easily dismissed.  This idea has no merit.  

Focus on “Accountability”: The rule is intended to make it easier for the President to remove those in policy-influencing positions deemed not to be sufficiently loyal to his administration.  This is not how the federal government should operate.  I worked for EPA for over 33 years in both Republican and Democratic administrations and we never had this type of accountability.  

&quot;At-Will&quot; Employment: Schedule Policy/Career employees essentially become &quot;at-will&quot; employees, meaning they can be terminated without cause.  This is totally contrary to labor laws and common sense.  Also, this can foster retaliation when a new administration comes into power. 

Appeal Rights: They also lose appeal rights allowing them to challenge their dismissal.  How can this be legal?  How is this not a total nonsensical idea?  Labor laws should apply to these situations. 

Constitutional Duty: Employees in Schedule Policy/Career are expected to faithfully implement administration policies, and failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.

This proposal is a clear effort to circumvent long standing merit system protections and undermines the principles of democratic governance, nonpartisan expertise, and institutional continuity.

It is critical to acknowledge that this rule does not strengthen the civil service. It weakens it by design.

The proposed rule falsely frames due process protections as obstacles to effective management and misrepresents a selective reading of civil service history to justify the politicization of federal personnel. Contrary to the claim that this rule will strengthen democracy, it removes structural safeguards that prevent political interference in public administration and decision making.

The proposed rule leans heavily on the claim that the Pendleton Act of 1883 and subsequent reforms never intended to grant civil servants meaningful protections from removal. This is misleading. The purpose of the Pendleton Act and the Lloyd La Follette Act of 1912 was to create a nonpartisan professional workforce insulated from political coercion. The rule itself cites George William Curtis, a principal architect of the Pendleton Act, who explicitly said that the intent was to avoid sealing up incompetency and negligence by allowing removals with documented cause—not to fac...

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

Why? 

Because studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.">I would like to ask that you push to fight Trump&#x27;s politicization of public services.

The proposal’s focus on senior career staff creates a chilling effect that will undermine agency effectiveness. Making experienced professionals fear political retaliation or being scapegoated for fulfilling their duties will not foster accountability or improved performance.

Docket ID OPM-2025-0004
RIN 3206-AO80

I am strongly opposed to this proposed rule change. Civil service protections are in place for a reason, to ensure that we attract and retain experienced federal workers. Our civil workers have specific expertise and experience and have a sense of history, having worked for multiple administrations. This knowledge is valuable to the offices they hold and to provide context for why certain regulations, decisions, protections were carried out a certain way in the past. We have seen over the past few months haphazard cutting of staff. AI generated letters that informed probationary staff they were fired for &quot;performance reasons&quot; regardless of their actual performance, resulting in us firing those who&#x27;s only fault was being recently hired or promoted.

I am deeply troubled by this move by OPM. Employees can already be removed for poor performance or for misconduct. Their rights under chapter 45 and chapter 75 should not be removed. They should have the right to appeal when accused. This rule change gives way too much power to the executive branch for whomever is in office. Please keep in place the existing protections and do not instill schedule F changes proposed in Docket ID OPM-2025-0004.">I am commenting on the proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management

I strongly oppose this change as this reclassification of over 50,000 federal workers would leave so many essential federal workers in extremely vulnerable positions to be fired for political reasons. Although our government policies shift as different parties lead our country, the infrastructure of the United States Government is maintained by thousands of non-partisan roles that benefit the Country as a whole. This proposed new rule would erode the trust of the American people even farther, and will impact our country&#x27;s stability in innumerable ways. 
US workers are put under great stress and pressure, and the way to better motivate workers is to provide opportunities for them to feel supported and safe. This proposed new rule would do the opposite, and would gut the infrastructure that makes our systems run, let alone run smoothly.

It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees’ constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a
professional, independent civil service. Specific concerns are presented below:

* Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of “policy-influencing” roles to make it easier to purge career staff. It’s the latest attempt from this Administration to replace professionalism with ideological alignment.

* Massive Expansion of At-Will Employment: The proposed rule would dramatically expand the number of civil servants who serve at the pleasure of the President from approximately 4,000 political appointees to potentially hundreds of thousands of what had been career employees.

* Ideologically Driven Rulemaking: OPM makes sweeping claims about political “resistance” in the civil service based on cherry-picked anecdotes and selective surveys, using these to justify maximalist removal authority.
* Undermines Civil Service Integrity: This proposed ...

Such a change and alteration in language, which leads to a change in job status, security, etc., belittles career civil servants&#x27; efforts to serve the common good and the American people.

As I understand it, the Civil Service Reform and Pendleton Acts sought to curtail nepotism and cronyism as well as prevent career civil servants from being hired and fired based on an administration&#x27;s political leanings. Unfortunately, if the OPM&#x27;s proposed rule makes civil servants into at-will employees, this creates further challenges for those currently working for or wanting to serve our country in the future. It is therefore predictable that the following will occur:
-The loss of a great number of civil servants will leave our country susceptible to a lack of expertise and result in &#x27;brain drain&#x27; in a country known for leaders and set standards in diverse fields.
-With fewer colleagues in federal departments, there will be greater pressure on the backs of those who stay behind, and they will need to exert energy helping advise new colleagues even though they may not possess senior expertise.
-A new system of &#x27;at-will employees&#x27; will breed a culture of those who don&#x27;t take their jobs as seriously as career civil servants did, since it removes the self-respect and sense of duty tha...

It would definitely not improve performance, accountability, and responsiveness; in fact, it would do just the opposite.

Technology in government is not just about code — it’s about building digital infrastructure that is fair, reliable, and trusted by the public. That trust depends on civil servants being empowered to prioritize user needs, accessibility, data privacy, and long-term sustainability over short-term political interests. Turning experienced technologists into at-will employees introduces a chilling effect on innovation and integrity. It would discourage experts from joining or staying in government and increase the risk of partisan interference in mission-critical systems — from benefits delivery to election infrastructure to disaster response platforms.

This rule does not increase accountability. In fact, it removes key safeguards that ensure public servants can raise concerns, surface technical realities, and defend the public interest without fear of political retaliation. A professionalized civil service allows for continuity, stability, and the independent judgment necessary to serve all Americans — regardless of who is in power.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule to establish a new “Schedule Policy/Career (P/C)” federal employee classification.

This proposal threatens to undermine the merit-based foundations of the federal civil service and opens the door to the politicization of roles that are meant to be nonpartisan and professional. The American public depends on a stable, expert federal workforce to implement policies effectively and without undue political influence. Reclassifying career civil servants into a new category that lacks competitive hiring procedures and due process protections risks turning career positions into political appointments.

Such a move could discourage qualified professionals from entering or remaining in public service, reduce institutional knowledge, and ultimately harm the effectiveness and integrity of government operations. The potential for political retaliation or ideological purging of federal employees—simply because they are seen as insufficiently loyal to the administration in power—is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the principles of a democratic government.

I urge the Office of Personnel Management to abandon this proposed rule and instead reinforce protections that ensure a skilled, impartial, and accountable civil service.">To Whom It May Concern,

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

My guiding political light is Article 25 of the UN Universal declaration of Human Rights. Article 25 in particular is generous in its provisions. So is the rest of document, if to a lesser degree. 

It is well to remember that the UNUDHR was drafted in the aftermath of WW2, to assure such carnage wouldn&#x27;t occur again. Article 25 reads: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
    “Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.”

We can see that the basic physical requirements of all of us are fundamental human rights. Not privileges. 

If we don’t have a civil service talented in more than being loyal to the billionaires in the Trump regime, how are such blessings of the collective to be administered? This doesn’t even mention the quotidian bumps and bruises Americans count on their government to ameliorate.

If the proposed rule is finalized, no sensible, smart person will join the civil service, which will make space for insensible, poor performers. When that happens, government agencies will not be able to perform to meet their expected services to the public, causing the public to lose confidence in their government.

I write based on my experience of over 32 years working as an analyst and advisor for the US Environmental Protection Agency. In those years I have seen the dedication and hard work of my fellow employees as we endeavored to scrupulously follow the laws enacted by Congress. I have also seen bad results when political appointees were more interested in currying favor with the then-current administration than in following the rule of law.
I believe that the Proposed Rule would contravene the very purpose for which the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was enacted. By effectively changing employees into “at will” employees, the Proposed Rule can be expected to turn a significant number of additional federal employees into political sycophants, primarily focused on pleasing whatever party is in power, rather than administering the laws enacted by Congress. May it never be so!
Effective mechanisms already exist to remove employees who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic purpose by intentionally subverting lawful Presidential directives. The Proposed Rule is not necessary for those purposes. Rather, it acts to unde...

As a scientist and associate professor at a major research university, I have served on National Institutes of Health (NIH) study sections for over five years. I have reviewed applications on more than fifteen different NIH panels across four study sections. These panels are composed of independent scientists from across the country and operate with extraordinary rigor, fairness, and transparency. The peer review process works because it is shielded from political interference. It protects the integrity of science, ensures accountability, and upholds the credibility of federal funding decisions.

For science to function, it is of the utmost importance that scientists remain agnostic to political ideology, religious affiliation, or any other allegiance to a particular faction. The power of science lies in its objectivity. Researchers must be free to pursue evidence wherever it leads, without fear of political consequence or pressure. This impartiality is not a luxury — it is the foundation of the scientific method and a key reason why American science has earned global leadership and trust. Undermining this principle would weaken not only the quality of scientific discovery but also the credibility of federal institutions that rely on it.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reject this rule and protect the integrity of the merit...

My work involves tariff regulation, where objective analysis, coordination with other federal agencies, and adherence to national security considerations are essential. The success of this work depends on a civil service that is shielded from political coercion and rooted in fact-based decision-making.

Reestablishing Schedule F would diminish both accountability and performance. It would allow for arbitrary removals based on political preference and create a chilling effect that undermines innovation, critical thinking, and institutional integrity.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

              title="Dear office of personnel management,

Equitable access to public health and NIH scientific funding is essential and a fundamental right for all US citizens. Political interference with NIH grants assessment will undoubtedly destroy the scientific integrity of federal grants and impact the health of millions of human beings in the United States.

Making NIH Institute and Center Directors political employees subject to unregulated whims of the current presidential administration is unethical and irresponsible. Human health should not be subjected to irrational political interventional. Defunding the NIH and changing fundamental human health policies is killing our country, and horrific decisions already made without any scientific rationale or basis have caused irreparable harm to our country. Sequelae of these senseless &#x27;decisions&#x27; will also continue to harm US citizens for decades to come.

Who eliminates funding for children with cancer? Pediatric oncology only receives 4% of the NCI budget at baseline, and recent governmental decisions to reduce or delay funding for critical childhood cancer research will undoubtedly lead to reduced cure rates, lack of critical needed new therapies, and more children dying.

It is imperative that the government takes our concerns seriously and addresses needed change in important ways beneficial to scientific advancement and health of US citizens.

Schedule F reclassify federal scientists as policymakers and subject them to presidential appointment and removal. This is detrimental to the American public and a threat to scientific progress in the United States. 

The role of federal scientists, including scientific advisors and grant reviewers, is to make sure that the federal government is spending money on tangible, worthwhile research for the American people. Federal scientists are appoint on their scientific merit, accrued over decades of rigorous work, and understand how to investigate relationships in the world that lead to improving lives of the American people. 

The ability for the president to appoint and remove them introduces political interference in this process; instead of funding what is scientifically sound and improve American people&#x27;s lives, Schedule F will allow the president direct ability to fund or stop any scientific research at his discretion. This is a gross overstep of presidential power in obstructing science, which the objective method by which the American people gain access to ever improving healthcare treatments and life-altering technology. This destructs scientific integrity of federal grants by having politically-biased reviewers control objective science for subjective political gain. This directly undermines the integrity of federal grants, which first and foremost serves the interest of the public.

              title="I write to support maintaining a merit based Federal civil service.  “Schedule F” (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion. The US is already unusual in the degree to which it reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political appointees. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.

I oppose Schedule F in its entirety; more specifically, the proposed amendments to 5 CFR Part 213 and 5 CFR part 752 are contrary to Congress&#x27;s intent to create a merit-based civil service free from undue partisan political influence, in accordance with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act of 1990. Congress has determined that an effective and efficient federal civil service must be protected from partisan and improper influences. The current Excepted Services categories are intentionally limited and narrow in scope to properly carry out Congress&#x27;s intent. OPM may not choose to disregard Congressional mandates in the manner proposed in this rule.">I write to support maintaining a merit based Federal civil service.  “Schedule F” (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and ...</span>

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

              title="I strongly oppose the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, &quot;Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.&quot;

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reject this rule and protect the integrity of the merit...

If implemented, this reclassification will give a sitting president the power to remove and replace scientific grant reviewers and civil servants based on ideological alignment rather than expertise.

While some may see this as a way to purge voices they disagree with, they should also consider the long-term consequences: this same mechanism could just as easily be used by a future Democratic administration to install reviewers and science advisors who prioritize progressive policy goals—such as expanding federal funding for vaccine mandates, gun violence research, DEI-focused studies, or climate justice initiatives.

In short, this rule will not protect any ideology. It will expose every administration to the temptation of politicizing scientific funding. Once this door is opened, it will never be closed. It invites a pendulum of politically motivated purges that will undermine the credibility and stability of government-funded research for decades to come.

              title="I strongly oppose the proposed reclassification of career civil service positions, including those at NIH such as Scientific Review Officers (SROs) and Program Officers (POs), into Schedule F. Such a reclassification risks politicizing these critical roles, potentially undermining the fundamental integrity of scientific research and diminishing public trust in federally-funded science.

Career NIH employees, particularly SROs and POs, ensure the impartial review and management of research grants based on scientific merit and public health importance, independent of political influence. Introducing at-will employment conditions for these positions would threaten this essential impartiality, potentially leading to decisions influenced more by political alignment than by rigorous scientific evaluation.

Historically, instances where scientific decisions were perceived as politically influenced have significantly eroded public confidence. For example, previous policy shifts that were viewed as politically motivated in areas like environmental science and public health guidelines have led to skepticism and reduced compliance with scientifically-informed public health directives. The current structure helps protect the scientific decision-making process from such vulnerabilities.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

This interpretation will have devastating effects on American science.  Scientific expertise in specific subject areas is something that takes decades to accrue.

This comment is submitted in response to the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed rule, published under Docket Number OPM-2025-0004, concerning the creation of Schedule Policy/Career and the corresponding removal of chapter 43 and 75 procedural protections for certain policy-influencing federal positions.

While the stated goal of increasing employee accountability is valid and necessary, the proposed structural shift toward at-will employment for career civil servants in policy-influencing roles raises substantial concerns related to governance integrity, nonpartisan service, and democratic stability.

 Legal and Governance Implications
	1.	Erosion of Due Process Protections:
The proposed rule circumvents longstanding statutory protections under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75. These frameworks exist to ensure career federal employees are insulated from arbitrary removal and politically motivated retaliation. Eliminating these protections in the name of efficiency poses a constitutional risk, especially for employees expected to implement, not blindly obey, directives that may raise ethical or legal red flags.
	2.	Chilling Effect on Institutional Dissent and Expertise:
Career professionals bring institutional memory and subject matter expertise critical to government continuity. The threat of at-will removal for non-aligned views—even when those views are technically sound or legally grounded—would foster a culture of compliance over conscienc...

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

It will be weaponized against those who want to uphold the rule of law. Federal employees at SSA have already had their speech stifled in fear of retaliation from this government, when they felt they could not answer DOGE truthfully about the lack of widespread fraud in Social Security payments. The point of this scheduling is to make government officials into the personal henchmen of the president and not the public servants of the American people. It is not a stretch to say that this particular administration has a history of taking actions that extend well beyond its legal authority (see any of the myriad of recent court cases that have come out against it on unlawfully deporting migrants, stealing already appropriated funding from universities, and trying to deport a permanent resident student for writing an op-ed). This illegality includes actions taken by DOGE which threaten the privacy of every American citizen (and may have already caused material harm, as evidence exists that suggests Russian spies have exfiltrated data from the NLRB via credentials created for DOGE). Given the stakes, we need people working at the government who feel safe enough to offer their own opinion and who follow the law, even if superiors wish to go against it. It is easy to see how ...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.

I chose this path because the biomedical research institutions in the United States have been world leaders in their field and I believe in the integrity of these institutions. At a recent conference I heard from scientists who committed their lives to HIV research about how successful the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) response to HIV has been. HIV, which was previously a death sentence for patients, is now a chronic disease that is well controlled for the majority of patients. The progress on therapies for HIV, and so many other diseases, made by the United States in the past century would not have have been possible without the great scientists in leadership positions as NIH Institute and Center Directors, as well as Institute Division Directors. 

This new regulation would result in the reclassification of all NIH Institute and Center Directors as well as Institute Division Directors as political appointees and thereby dramatically politicize NIH and increase the turnover of key positions, limiting longer-term planning and execution. This proposed new regulation would inject political interference into the research grant assessment and award process and destroy the scientific integrity of the federal grant award process and thereby devastate the...

The idea of reinstating Schedule F represents one of the most dangerous threats to the integrity of the United States federal government in modern times. At its core, Schedule F would politicize vast swaths of the career civil service, stripping essential job protections from thousands of federal employees whose primary qualifications are expertise, impartiality, and a commitment to public service, not political loyalty.

The American civil service system, built over more than a century, was designed explicitly to shield public administration from partisan manipulation. This reform traces directly back to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted in response to rampant political patronage and corruption during the so-called &quot;spoils system.&quot; The Pendleton Act replaced cronyism with a merit-based hiring system, protecting the government from becoming a revolving door of political loyalists. This ensures that professionals administer the law as opposed to party operatives with a political agenda or worse, sycophants.

Schedule F is a brazen attempt to reverse these foundational reforms. It would create a loophole whereby any role deemed “policy-influencing” could be reclassified, allowing appointees to fire seasoned professionals and replace them with ideologically aligned individuals. This would effectively purge the government of institutional knowledge, scientific and legal expertise, ... [truncated]">Why Schedule F is a deeply harmful proposal for American democracy

Without scientific superiority, we cannot have global economic or military superiority. Academic science is the most important component of our economic and military power. While industrial and corporate science does a good job of taking scientific discovery to market, the efforts of industrial and corporate science amounts to only the last mile of the journey. It is academic science that truly does the heavy lifting. Introducing political influence into the processes by which federal scientific grants are assessed and awarded will destroy the scientific backbone of America and undermine our most important source of economic and military global superiority. To put it another way, introducing political influence into the federal scientific grants process will necessarily and inevitably erode our position as a global power by undermining our ability for scientific advancement.

It is the gold standard for scientific review in the world, and it has made the scientific enterprise of American scientists the best in the world.

The central principle is unbiased scientific review by bona fide experts--chosen for their expertise and no other reason. Although the NIH does have many calls for grants, most of the funding goes to investigator initiated grants, &quot;R01s&quot;, submitted by individual investigators who are following leads based on their own discoveries, not from ideas proposed by others.

This process is truly the best that science has to offer.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category. The removal of such protection violates the Fifth Amendment due process rights of federal civil servants, specifically by removing the employees&#x27; interest in their tenure protections.

I write to express my profound opposition to the proposed implementation of Schedule F, which poses an existential threat to the integrity of American scientific research and the federal granting process that has made the United States a global leader in innovation.

The proposed regulation&#x27;s language regarding &quot;substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking&quot; fundamentally misunderstands the nature of scientific advancement. Scientific progress depends on:

- Merit-based evaluation by subject matter experts who understand the technical nuances of proposed research
- Continuity of expertise that allows for long-term strategic planning and program development
- Protection from political pressure that ensures funding decisions are based on scientific merit, not partisan considerations
- Institutional knowledge built over decades that cannot be replaced by political appointees

The reported plan to convert all NIH Institute and Center Directors, along with division directors, into political appointments would:

1. Destroy institutional memory - These positions require deep understanding of specific disease areas, research methodologies, and the scientific community. Political turnover would eliminate crucial expertise.

2. Undermine peer review - The cornerstone of scientific integrity is peer review by experts. Political appointees lack the specialized knowledge to evaluate complex scientific proposals fairly.

It invites obvious conflicts of interest, corruption, and immense risk to governmental efficiency by way of constant and unnecessary disruption. Vastly more effective means of improving government efficiency exist that do not imperil the nation in such a way. 

We are accustomed, as Americans, to thinking that the gears of government move too slowly. This is, in fact, by design to avoid overreaching by any given branch. When genuine emergency arises mechanisms exist to allow for necessary rapid response. 

This change would merely invite further abuse and, in effect, turn the government at its lowest levels into a revolving door of ideologues. 

The document claims bipartisanship in hiring practices, but given other actions by the executive and even the barest understanding of human nature and American political culture as it exists, we know that is false. Only a pretense of such neutrality would exist, if at all. 

This change makes us as Americans less safe, less trusting, and actively pushes our democracy towards a violent fracturing point as the undulations of partisanship only further stoke a dangerous undercurrent of violence we saw a mere “flash in the pan” of on Jan. 6, 2021.">It is a flatly unethical, anti-founding action to allow the executive the ability to freely fire most government employees on a whim.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees’ constitutional and statutory rights.  Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a professional, independent civil service.  Specific concerns are presented below.
•	·       Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of “policy-influencing” roles to make it easier to purge career staff. It’s the latest attempt from this Administration to replace professionalism with ideological alignment.
•	·       Massive Expansion of At-Will Employment: The proposed rule would dramatically expand the number of civil servants who serve at the pleasure of the President from approximately 4,000 political appointees to potentially hundreds of thousands of what had been career employees.

As a lifelong advocate, nonprofit leader, and American deeply invested in the integrity of our public institutions, I write to express my strong opposition to any proposal to reinstate or expand “Schedule F”—a classification that would allow tens of thousands of federal civil servants to be reclassified as political appointees. This effort poses an existential threat to the professional, nonpartisan civil service that underpins our democratic government.

I run a national animal welfare nonprofit, the Rabbit.org Foundation, which focuses on public education, advocacy, and community-building. Our work depends on the consistent application of evidence-based policies from federal agencies such as the USDA, the CDC, and the Department of the Interior. If federal roles—especially scientific, regulatory, and administrative positions—are filled based on political loyalty rather than expertise and continuity, the implications for public trust and effectiveness are dire.

Animal welfare is just one of many areas that rely on a stable civil service. Whether we’re addressing the regulation of pet sales, improving conditions in research labs, or protecting wildlife habitats, we count on career officials who are guided by law, science, and long-term public interest—not short-term political agendas. Under a Schedule F system, key decision-makers could be replaced overnight, upending years of regulatory work and silencing professionals who speak truth to power....

              title="Public Comment on Proposed Reinstatement of Schedule F

As an HR professional who has supported federal government contract employees across a range of agencies, I’ve seen firsthand the importance of a stable, apolitical civil service. These employees are expected to serve with integrity, not allegiance to any political ideology. Reinstating Schedule F would undermine that expectation and create lasting harm.

Schedule F would allow for the reclassification of career federal employees, stripping them of due process and merit-based protections. This opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing, threatening the very foundation of fair and effective government operations. It risks losing experienced professionals with institutional knowledge—people who know how to keep systems running, ensure compliance, and deliver vital services to the American public.

While accountability is essential in any workforce, it should be upheld through transparent, performance-based systems—not by removing protections in a way that invites political interference. Public servants must be able to do their jobs without fear of retaliation, regardless of their personal political beliefs.

We need more individuals who take their role in government seriously—who understand they serve the American people, not a party or administration. Schedule F would deter such individuals from entering or staying in public service.

              title="I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implemen...

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

As a state government employee who administers a federally funded program, it is impossible to conduct the program without thorough planning and research. And it is impossible to conduct thorough planning and research if the very foundations of the funding can be changed or removed overnight without warning. We can&#x27;t promise that the funds will be there, and therefor can&#x27;t be sure that any plans we make will happen. The federal government must be stable, accountable, and honest in its dealings with state governments. To have such a mercurial and chaotic landscape of uncertainty at the source of our program&#x27;s funding, it weakens the work we do, and our work is vital to a well-run state government. The federal government must keep its promises and adhere to the funds and agreements it makes with states. And to do that, the federal agencies can&#x27;t be run by any one person&#x27;s whims. They must be run by statute. And statute must be stable and safe. Giving any individual too much power and control, no matter what political party happens to be in power at the time, erodes the abilities of the system as a whole. Our nation has already attempted cronyism in the past, and we know that it does not work. There is no reason to hurt our democracy with a second attempt.">The proposed regulations would have disastrous impacts in nearly every aspect of American life.

              title="I strongly oppose creation of a Schedule “Policy/Career” for federal workers. This proposed regulation would decimate the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, non-partisan federal workforce for nearly 150 years. Merit-based federal employment means a more efficient government for American taxpayers and better public services for the American people. This proposed regulation would make our federal agencies less effective and expose the American public to the type of corruption that civil service laws were enacted to protect against.
First, the creation of Schedule “Policy/Career” and the broad way in which it is being interpreted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are contrary to Constitutional due process. It has long been recognized that non-probationary government workers are entitled to due process before they can be removed or have other employment actions taken against them. See Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924, 935-936 (1997); Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985). The importance of maintaining due process and having a merit-based apolitical civil service is also enshrined in federal statute. The proposed regulations would deprive a large number of federal workers of their due process rights. 
The sweeping nature of Schedule “Policy/Career” also undermines important federal statutes. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish merit-based emplo...

OPM’s new rule cuts red tape and allows career bureaucrats to be reprimanded for poor job performance or misconduct, such as corruption or partisanship.

In any industry, rogue employees are held accountable to someone. Now, government employees will be held accountable for lack of performance or inaction.

These regulations threaten the scientific integrity of federal grants,  

Project managers, Principle Investigators, division heads, should be appointed to help shape and direct scientific programs. Having these positions be political makes them subject to the whims of who is in office rather than to adhere to the goal of making scientific progress.

I  object to the proposed new regulation that would institute &quot;Schedule F&quot;. a plan to enable the President to reclassify tens of thousands of government jobs as “policymaking positions” wherein the employees would serve at the pleasure of the President, and could be terminated summarily without the usual review and appeal process currently afforded Federal employees . This regulation would reclassify jobs that once fell under civil service protection. Please do not pass or accept this change. Politicizing the NIH will increase the turnover of key positions, limiting longer-term planning and execution of major scientific programs.

Already, scientists and program managers take a pay cut to work at NIH, NCI and other government scientific agencies. If we now add in complete lack of any security and make jobs subject to the whims of a political administration, no one with any talent will take those jobs.

reduced and/or staffed only with political loyalists, it would create chaos in the federal agencies.

I, Michael P. Radway, submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025).


As a retired, 28+ year federal employee, I write to express my STRONG opposition to the Proposed Rule.

I worked for almost three decades as a federal employee, retiring as a very senior federal employee.  Implementation of this rule will lead to an irreparable decline in the quality of the federal workforce, and will inevitably result in its politicization.  The federal civil service was created over a century ago to specifically prevent the kind of politicization this rule will foster.  It will result in the loss of thousands if not millions of years of experience and expertise, will make it much harder to both attract and retain federal employees, and will reduce productivity. 

The merit system was created to prevent the politization of the federal workforce and to promote non-partisan expertise.  This rule would DESTROY practices that have served our nation well for more than a century under Presidents of both parties.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

This move would erode the foundation of a nonpartisan, professional federal workforce—one that is designed to implement laws and programs approved by Congress, not to serve the political whims of any one administration.

The civil service exists to protect the integrity, continuity, and accountability of our government institutions. Replacing experienced, apolitical leaders with political loyalists undermines that mission and poses a direct threat to effective governance, public trust, and the checks and balances our democracy depends on.

I strongly oppose this proposal. It endangers the impartial administration of government and opens the door to politicization of roles that must remain neutral to ensure the fair and lawful execution of our nation’s laws.">As a concerned citizen, I am alarmed by the proposed rule change to allow the conversion of tens of thousands of civil service roles into political appointments.

The scientific process fundamentally depends on objectivity and independent expertise. By increasing the number of politically appointed employees in these positions, the federal granting agencies will therefore become more susceptible to political influence, potentially leading to the implementation of policies that are not based on sound scientific principles and rigorous scientific evidence. This could have devastating consequences for public health, national security, technological advancement, and global competitiveness. 

Therefore, I urge the administration to reconsider Schedule F and instead prioritize a merit-based civil service that values expertise and impartiality.

As an example:  I am researching immunotherapy for pediatric cancer treatment. My funding largely comes from NIH grants which are supervised by committees made up of very intelligent scientists who are experts in their field. These experts are essentially the gate keepers for what research is funded and must be insightful, smart, and look for research they believe drives the field forward to determine potential cures or knowledge which could lead to curing cancer. Their supervisors are themselves government employee policy makers, who again rose to their position because they are intelligent, driven scientists who have performed research which the scientific community holds in high regard.  If these persons were to be fired to make way for a policy maker that aligns with the president&#x27;s view over that of the scientific community, it degrades the output of the US. This is not because president&#x27;s are stupid, this is because presidents(as of DJT 2nd term) have never held a scientific position, received a scientific PhD degree,  or preformed s...

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

              title="I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would create a new Schedule Policy/Career category of federal employment, which would convert existing career civil service roles into effectively at-will positions. This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.

The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.

While misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with &quot;undermining the democratic process&quot; sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.

The American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution—not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.

While there are many things the Founding Fathers could not have predicted about the nation they created two hundred and fifty years into the future, I&#x27;m sure they would be absolutely aghast at the idea that half the Legislative branch would bend the knee and refuse to exercise their own power to make law in favor of a President legislating through Executive Orders.

Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Politics is an essential part of our democracy. The Legislative branch passed bills which, if signed by the President, become the law of the land. These laws set the direction in which our national government moves. These bills are the subject of a great deal of debate within congress and in the public sphere. Members of Congress and Senators examine them in formal committee sessions and informal town hall meetings. The public express their opinions through communications with their elected representatives in many forms. Groups of interested community members lobby to make their positions known. This is an important political process. 

Once a bill is passed and signed into law, it becomes the duty of the Executive Branch to put it into action. This branch consists of both the political and the non-political. The President is responsible for making over 9,000 appointments (identified quadrennially in the Plum Book) to ensure that the political direction of the Office of the President is transmitted through the various arms of the Executive Branch.

It blatantly undermines the merit-based system established under the Pendleton Act, turning essential civil servants into disposable political pawns.

This proposal would erode institutional expertise and accountability, harming government efficiency and effectiveness. It deliberately politicizes public service positions, silences independent voices, and jeopardizes transparent governance.

The Office of Personnel Management must immediately withdraw this harmful proposal to protect a competent, impartial, and professional federal workforce from further political manipulation

Removing civil service protections also threatens the independence and effectiveness of federal agencies by discouraging candid advice and reducing institutional knowledge. Such changes erode public trust and diminish governmental efficiency.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

The Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed creation of a new Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) designation raises significant legal and policy concerns, particularly regarding due process, civil service protections, and the politicization of the federal workforce. Below is a substantive critique based on statutory, constitutional, and precedential grounds:

1. Elimination of Civil Service Protections Violates Due Process &amp; Merit System Principles
The proposal converts federal employees into at-will workers, stripping them of Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeals and other procedural safeguards. This undermines:
&gt;5 U.S.C. § 2301 (Merit System Principles), which guarantees fair treatment and protections against arbitrary removal.
&gt;5 U.S.C. § 7513, which provides adverse action protections for competitive service employees.
&gt;Due Process under the Fifth Amendment, as recognized in Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill (1985), which held that public employees with a property interest in their jobs are entitled to notice and a hearing before termination.

By denying P/C employees MSPB appeals, the rule effectively deprives them of constitutionally protected property interests without due process. Courts have consistently struck down such attempts (See Stone v. FDIC, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), reinforcing that career civil servants cannot be stripped of protections without cause).

Contrary to the assertions in the section, bureaucratic autonomy PROTECTS democracy, when, for example, civil servants respond to other legitimate authority, for example congress or the courts, and not the president. Contrary to assertions in the document, the president is not the sole determiner of what civil servants should do.

Specific issues:

As a scientist, I am greatly concerned with the impact of the proposed changes on our agencies that implement the will of congress in funding scientific research.

Schedule F and this rule change is in direct conflict of the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883 (enacted after the assassination of president James A Garfield) and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 which prohibits the hiring, firing, or demotion of government employees based on political patronage or favoritism. 

The Schedule F order is in direct conflict of reducing government corruption and efficiency. The act of demoting and firing civil servants without merit-based criteria examination would have unmitigated potential to corrupt the availability and management of public resources.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

              title="I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would create a new Schedule Policy/Career category of federal employment, which would convert existing career civil service roles into effectively at-will positions. This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.

The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.

While misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with &quot;undermining the democratic process&quot; sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.

The American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution—not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.

I am strongly opposed to this proposed rule change. Civil service protections are in place for a reason, to ensure that we attract and retain experienced federal workers. Our civil workers have specific expertise and experience and have a sense of history, having worked for multiple administrations. This knowledge is valuable to the offices they hold and to provide context for why certain regulations, decisions, protections were carried out a certain way in the past. We have seen over the past few months haphazard cutting of staff. AI generated letters that informed probationary staff they were fired for &quot;performance reasons&quot; regardless of their actual performance, resulting in us firing those who&#x27;s only fault was being recently hired or promoted.

I am deeply troubled by this move by OPM. Employees can already be removed for poor performance or for misconduct. Their rights under chapter 45 and chapter 75 should not be removed. They should have the right to appeal when accused. This rule change gives way too much power to the executive branch for whomever is in office. Please keep in place the existing protections and do not instill schedule F changes proposed in Docket ID OPM-2025-0004.">I am commenting on the proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management

A handful of anecdotal cases do not equal widespread resistance to the administration&#x27;s policies, and they certainly do not constitute sufficient evidence to justify the proposed rule&#x27;s conclusions or solutions. Furthermore, the proposed rule runs completely contrary to the intentions of existing civil service laws. The Civil Service Reform Act and The Pendleton Act were meant to end the spoils system and to keep politics out of hiring and firing decisions. The proposed rule, while it purports to preserve merit hiring, is fundamentally opposed to this goal, because it will reclassify career civil servants as at-will employees for the express purpose of making them easier to fire, regardless of merit. And finally, there are numerous ways in which the proposed rule will ultimately cost the federal government money. The OPM has failed to quantify costs from increased EEO complaints and potentially thousands of federal court complaints alleging constitutional due process and First Amendment violations. If Schedule P/C leads to large scale firings, this is likely to lead to a flood of federal court litigation. OPM has also claimed that the policy will not cause ...

              title="I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would create a new Schedule Policy/Career category of federal employment, which would convert existing career civil service roles into effectively at-will positions. This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.
The current protections in place for career employees are not barriers—they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.
While misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with &quot;undermining the democratic process&quot; sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.
The American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution—not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.

              title="I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.

It is essential they remain career employees relatively immune the political winds of the day.

Studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight.

Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions. My main concern is that this new policy will politicize the NIH (and other grantmaking institutions) and the science that is pursued. There is a role for science in policymaking but there should be a limited role for policy in deciding what science should be done. As a scientist with over 20 years of experience in the field of public health, I am very familiar with the grantmaking process. This change would increase the turnover of key positions at these institutions as well as the turnover of priorities. Science and knowledge are incremental and such turnover would be hugely detrimental to long-term planning. Shifting priorities as new political appointees come in will damage our ability to build the evidence base for discovery, synthesis, and policy, particularly if new priorities are contrary to the old ones and lines of research are hampered or terminated (e.g., COVID-19, vaccines, disparities).

This is not the &#x27;best&#x27; reading of the statutory authority as required by Loper Bright.  

The data provided is unsupported.  The data discusses 3rd party data, no analysis of data from OPM or any agency itself. It also conflates data on adverse acitons against managers but does not identify the rates for policy-influencing positions. 

The current regulations provide for a way in which employees and managers can be held accountable providing due process. It is NOT a rationale basis to say the process is ineffective when the issue really is adequate training and HR support for managers and supervisors in order to hold employees accountable. This involves having an interactive performance plan process, having tangible, achievable, and realistic metrics on which to measure the employees performance, and support for managers in identifying poor performers. The root cause of poor performers often is lack of training and/or a lack of mentoring, not based on political beliefs.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

              title="Government employees should not have their statuses changed to “at will.”

Many people choose to make less money and be a civil servant because there are some protections against capricious firings. It is my opinion, those protections should be afforded to every U.S. employee (public or private sector).  However,  around 10,000 people are fired from the federal government for cause each year. If someone is not doing his/her job, they can be fired. They can also be fired for misconduct. The biggest difference is Feds have some appeal rights (again, those protections should be expanded). If the proper paperwork is done and supervisors document the issues properly, then there is no need to change the status of any government employee to “at will.”

What I think the architects of this particular provision fail to see is that even in the private sector, people are not just summarily fired because even in at will states, employers still prefer to have cause as a way to avoid lawsuits. 

This provision, if passed, will just end up in a legal battle that will ultimately cost taxpayers millions of dollars. The wise thing to do is focus on something else that will actually make a positive impact on society.

A strong, civil service that is based on merit and free from political influence is essential to a supporting a strong economy and an efficient and effective workforce. The creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which established a merit-based hiring process for federal employees.  The Schedule Policy/Career proposal which allows wide-ranging groups of career civil servants to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause will allow hiring and firing that is politically motivated.  I urge OPM to not implement this proposal.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#x27;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category.

Thus, I&#x27;m commenting on 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752, [Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004], RIN 3206-AO80, an attempt to provide more &quot;accountability&quot; for federal employees. That nomenclature of accountability is a bare-faced lie; the proposed rule provides not for accountability, but for persecution of hard-working public servants who have the temerity not to agree with every whim of the President&#x27;s office.  It&#x27;s one of the least American rules I can imagine, and it&#x27;s appalling that it&#x27;s even under consideration.  It&#x27;s a blatant attempt to stack the ranks of federal employees with loyalists, cowards, and yes-men who&#x27;ll agree to any overreach by the executive branch, and who&#x27;ll have no recourse if they don&#x27;t choose to do that. And even if that weren&#x27;t appalling on moral grounds, it&#x27;s a recipe for disaster to have federal employees who have no idea what they&#x27;re doing, and no experience doing it, running every system in America.  We&#x27;ve seen that already with the catastrophe that is DOGE&#x27;s work with the SSA and the IRS.

I can say that without fail when political forces other than policy begin to influence organizational operations, it is disastrous.  Protections for employees from these political forces ensure continuity and stability within organizations.  It allows them to follow what makes the most sense from an operational perspective, and promotes cohesion.  When this is disrupted, when organizational cohesion is threatened by individuals being subject to the whims of politics, we erode the staying power of these institutions.  Supervisors and managers become more focused on external forces than on their internal teams.  This leads to team-level dysfunction and development needs being overlooked. There is less willingness to innovate or move beyond status quo.  Employee dissatisfaction increases, and the only thing that keeps people in their jobs is their years of vested service.  Gross inefficiencies and a toxic workplace are the long-term results of eroding the firewall between politics and government operations.">As a consultant working to improve organizational efficiency, I have had direct experience observing how state and local governments function from the inside-out.

Civil service jobs should be nonpartisan and filled on the basis of expertise and experience, and not subject to someone’s political whims or personal extremist beliefs, religious or just fringe. Employees should not be afraid to speak their minds and make suggestions, fearing retribution.

 

Career civil servants have provided stability across different parties for decades, allowing the government to run more rationally, without the whims of whoever is in power. Allowing them to be fired “at will” would be very destructive. Replacing federal employees with politically aligned individuals will damage stability and efficiencies that come with long-term “institutional knowledge.” It will likely further erode public trust in our government.

 

Changing the current merit-based system is will lead to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality that has been stabilizing.

Further, making all NIH Institute and Center Directors and division directors political appointees would dramatically and disastrously politicize NIH and destroy the scientific integrity of federal grants decision-making. Changing course with each election cycle would also limit long-term planning.

Federal employees who work on policy should not be converted into at-will employees, vulnerable to retaliation and political pressure. Accountability in government must not come at the cost of due process or merit-based hiring. This rule threatens the foundations of a fair, nonpartisan civil service and opens the door to corruption and loyalty-based employment.

I urge OPM and federal leadership to withdraw this proposal immediately. Instead of undermining civil servants, we should be strengthening protections that support their integrity and dedication to public service.">I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule titled “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” This rule, which effectively revives the dangerous and discredited Schedule F policy under a new name, would pol...</span>

Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually.

I don&#x27;t believe that we should politicize civil service jobs. It will have a negative effect on the 3 items in the name of the proposed rule. It will decrease performance by having inexperienced people shuffle in and out of these jobs, reduce accountability, except to a political entity, and both will reduce responsiveness of the civil service overall. This is aside from the obvious corruption potential. I entered civil service on a mission, for lower pay, with the promise that the long career stability and benefits would enable me to be rewarded during retirement. There is no deep state conspiracy.  the deep state is what pays transfer payment to your grandmother and mother.

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing to express my deep-seated opposition to the proposed rule entitled “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” which would reintroduce elements of the previously rescinded Schedule F executive order.

I am profoundly concerned that this rule would fundamentally undermine the merit-based principles that are the cornerstone of the career civil service. It threatens to erode the nonpartisan integrity and institutional expertise that our government relies upon to serve the American people effectively and lawfully. Civil servants take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Their expertise helps the leaders elected by the American people to execute their vision. Allowing partisan hires, not based on skills, experience, and expertise will slow the work of the government and render it ineffective. Civil servants are charged with executing their leader’s vision and do not allow their subjective opinions to influence the outcome. In addition, the amount of time to staff up with new employees after each election would result in lost knowledge, unfinished projects, and a lack of results for the American people.

Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing a new “Schedule Policy/Career” category of at-will positions for career federal employees in so-called policy-influencing roles. This is a rebranded resurrection of Schedule F—designed to grant political leadership unchecked power to remove professionals for perceived disloyalty, often meaning anything short of uncritical compliance.

This is not about accountability. It is about control.

And while the current administration may believe it can wield this power selectively, the structural damage would outlast any presidency. Once career positions are stripped of protections, future administrations of either party can use this tool to retaliate or silence. That is not reform. That is sabotage dressed in regulatory language.

1. The Rule Misrepresents the Role of Career Civil Servants.

The rule implies that expressing legal or operational concerns justifies removal. That misrepresents what career employees are obligated to do: implement law ethically and within statutory bounds. Dissenting views and legal caution are not misconduct—they are hallmarks of professionalism. Removing those who offer it erodes both integrity and public trust.

Schedule F is a ridiculous attempt of an unhinged and senile &quot;leader&quot; to control the progression of academic research because he lacks the ability to understand even basic scientific facts. Unfortunately he is also surrounded by others with limited capacity. Implementing this in any meaningful way, will put those unqualified people in control of the nations health and will stall groundbreaking research, innovations and possible cures. Anyone living in this country expecting to receive quality medical care and hoping to receive access to new technology and cutting edge treatments should be terrified. Any human reading this comment should ask themselves how comfortable they would be having this regime make decisions about your medical care. Do you feel good about RFK&#x27;s ability to recommend an appropriate vaccine schedule for your children, your aging parents? Concerned about cancer? You should be. Someone who develops a type of cancer that researchers are diligently working to cure should expect at this point to wait much longer than they would have prior to this administration. I hope all who support this are feeling healthy enough to survive the next 4 years. Supporting this in any way makes you culpable for the fall out.">Re: Docket ID: OPM–2025–0004

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs.

This proposal represents an alarming threat to the foundations of the merit-based civil service system—an institution that has safeguarded the competence, impartiality, and integrity of the federal workforce for over 140 years.

Schedule F would dangerously erode the core protections established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to dismantle the corrupt spoils system and ensure that federal hiring and employment decisions are based on merit, not political loyalty. By allowing broad categories of career civil servants—especially those involved in policy development or analysis—to be reclassified and dismissed without cause, Schedule F invites the very abuses the Pendleton Act was designed to prevent.

This proposal is directly at odds with the statutory merit system principles laid out in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b), which guarantee that federal employment should be based on merit and free from political coercion. It also undermines the due process protections in 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which safeguard against arbitrary or retaliatory removals by requiring just cause and fair procedures. Stripping thousands of career officials of these protections not only threatens their job security—it endangers the government’s ability to function based on facts, expertise, and continuity.

Moreover, Schedule F would have a chilling effect on the willingness of ci...

              title="I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule to create the &quot;Schedule Policy/Career&quot; excepted service category, which would effectively revive the discredited Schedule F approach. This rule is a fundamentally flawed and dangerous shift in civil service governance for the following reasons:

The proposed rule would strip civil service protections from tens of thousands of career federal employees, making them at-will and subject to removal without cause or recourse. This undermines the core merit system principles established by the Pendleton Act and reinforced by the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which were designed to prevent the return of the patronage or &quot;spoils&quot; system and to ensure that employment decisions are based on merit, not politics.

By allowing broad reclassification of policy-related positions into at-will status, the rule opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This threatens the nonpartisan character of the civil service and risks turning federal agencies into instruments of political loyalty rather than public service. The proposal ignores the historical lessons of abuses that led to the establishment of civil service protections in the first place.

The rule appears to conflict with statutory due process requirements in Title 5 of the U.S. Code and the CSRA, which guarantee notice, explanation, and appeal rights for removals. Judicial precedent has repeatedly affirmed that the executive branch cannot unilaterally nullify these stat...

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

              title="As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

The proposal focuses on support for the incumbent president--that is clearly important when policy is at issue.  But such support is not the only factor in crafting good policy.  In particular, the proposal doesn&#x27;t indicate how something eventually mentioned--respectful and professional substantive disagreement--will be possible under the proposed system, which instead seems designed to chill the kind of constructive discussion that is core to true deliberation and the best analysis and decision-making.
