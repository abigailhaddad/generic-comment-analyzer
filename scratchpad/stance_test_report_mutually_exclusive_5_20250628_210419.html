These rules are in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Undermining this system could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by rejecting this proposed rule.">As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees.

-The proposed changes are overbroad and risk corruption in the federal workforce and government. The attempt to politicize the federal workforce will turn nonpartisan career positions into political appointments. This will remove neutrality, and future policies will not be made on fact-based determinations, but on the political objectives of the administration. This erodes trust and fairness in federal policy decision-making.  ">I am opposed to the proposed rule to institute Schedule F for at least the following reasons:

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

This proposal risks allowing fringe ideologies, including religious extremism, to influence federal policy and practice in ways that could discriminate against Americans who don’t share those beliefs. Our government must remain secular and fair in its service to all citizens.

But the proposed rule--a significant increase in at will employment and political preferment in hiring or firing--will not do so. It sidelines ability, experience and stability. Government employment already struggles to attract high performers, who have better paid options. The chief executive already enjoys its choice of leadership determined by political appointment; many administrations have successfully executed significant policy changes, lead by senior appointees and carried out by professional civil servants. The current leadership stands out in the number of policy changes it is implementing, with its chosen appointees and the existing civil service. No doubt there needs to be reform to allow release of bad employees; however, this dramatic shift to at will employment is not the answer. It ultimately weakens the very services that executive leaders, as well as citizens, depend upon to do the work of this country day after day.
