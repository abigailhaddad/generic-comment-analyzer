Hello. I understand that this meeting is to vote on vaccine recommendations, and I&#039;m writing because I am concerned that the current vaccines for Covid-19 will not be updated and easily available for whoever wants them.
All vaccines should continue to be monitored (there were already systems in place) and reconsidered when data shows that the harm outweighs the benefits, but as of this moment, the Covid vaccines are keeping more people alive and out of the hospital compared to Covid INFECTIONS, so I see no science-based reason to roll-back recommendations or pause updates that keep up with new variants.
Covid-19 is still causing harm (to multiple organ systems including the heart and brain) to even healthy people with even a mild case. Whether you use the term Long Covid or post-Covid symptoms, there is no denying that (1) multiple Covid infections are not good for the immune system, (2) the Covid vaccine wanes over time, and (3) Covid continues to mutate and change when there are few or no preventive measures in place like adequate ventilation in public spaces, paid sick leave, and free testing and masks. 
Please, please do not make it harder for people to access one of the few tools they have to protect themselves and their family from Covid.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, polio, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutab... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

In an interview with Chris Cuomo in June 2024, former CDC Director under Trump, Dr. Robert Redfield, said that he now uses Novavax in his private practice for the above reasons. Also, please recommend a new priming series for those switching to Novavax, that is, two shots 4-8 weeks apart followed by a booster at six months, then everyone to be boosted every 6 months.

First and foremost, I urge the CDC and ACIP to preserve an independent and transparent decision-making process. It is extremely troubling that expert advisors have been recently removed, and existing policies meant to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines are being undermined. The administration, including Mr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., must reverse these harmful actions. The strength of our public health institutions depends on expert input, free from political interference.

Second, every ACIP member must fully disclose all financial and other potential conflicts of interest. Integrity and public trust in ACIP&#039;s recommendations are only possible when transparency is non-negotiable.

It must also be essential that ACIP recognize what the scientific consensus continues to support: that FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and life-saving.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating these barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

It’s true that mRNA technology had been in development for about three decades. Understand, however, that no mRNA- based drugs or vaccines had received full regulatory approval for use in humans, prior to COVID. Operation Warp Speed (OWS) accelerated the process of testing, clinical trials, oversight, and distribution.

I don’t pretend to understand all of the biology involved here. From what I have read, it’s my understanding that the biggest challenge with this new technology is that mRNA drugs need a “delivery system.”
Although lipid-based delivery systems were being researched a few years pre- COVID, the problem was never actually resolved. Problems still persist, including inflammatory effects (similar to those seen with the inflammation of the heart muscle or myocarditis), and the fact that unprotected mRNA can trigger excessive immune responses.

Nevertheless, OWS helped to make the mRNA delivery system “reliable enough” for real-world use in vaccines.
After giving this matter much thought, I suspect that our differences come down to risk tolerance. Your fear over the likelihood of being hospitalized from COVID is greater than mine. My fear is greater with the known and unknown side-effects (both short &amp; long-term) of repeated vaccinations with this product.
Had I known in 2021 what I know now, I never would have gotten a COVID shot. In formulating my risk/benefit assessment, I consider the fact that today’s COVID-19 is thankfu... [truncated]">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

I urge you to reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, at least once a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations. 

I fear the possibility of further erosion of vaccine recommendations with the recent termination of all 17 CDC ACIP committee members. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is critical for access to safe and effective vaccines. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are experiencing outbreas of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and pertussis, with serious and possibly life-long consequences. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

Vaccine policy changes must be undertaken in a science-based, open, and transparent process that prioritizes public health. The COVID vaccine policy updates were done in a top-down fashion, without appropriate expert advisory committee input. PFDA’s VRBPAC committee members were not allowed to discuss the COVID vaccine policy changes at the May 22 meeting. There was no opportunity to provide public comment on the new policies before they were implemented.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. In February 2023 my then-20 month old fully vaccinated son contracted Covid, and 3 weeks later was unable to walk. He eventually was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, and the Pediatric Neurology Team at the Cleveland Clinic told us the Moderna vaccine most likely saved his life. He is still very much in recovery, and may be permanently disabled for the rest of his life. As a family and as part of a tight-knit community, we are desperate to stay up to date on all vaccines, if only to prevent a relapse of this horrible disorder. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and p... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

As the mother of a young child and a teenager, with various high risk older family members to care for, I believe that vaccine access for all — regardless of age or health status — is imperative. Healthy children cannot remain healthy without them, nor can adults remain healthy enough to work. Our precious economy depends on our ability to work and spend freely; medical issues arising from lack
of vaccination, and the resulting costs, can only result in less work and less economic growth. 

1. RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
2. Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
3. ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
4. ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
5. ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

Thank you.">
As the mother of a young child and a teenager, with various high risk older family members to care for, I believe that vaccine access for all — regardless of age or health status — is imperative.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously h...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Vaccination has positively affected me and my wife, who is immune-compromised. It allowed us to travel and get married safely in 2021 without endangering ourselves and our community.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

A full study of each vax on the childhood schedule should be undertaken. The rise of ADHD/Autism in our children can no longer be ignored nor the possible connection to the rise of the vaccine.  Do infants really need a Hep B shot?! No, probably not.  Please fix this terrible mess and let’s stop using our babies as guinea pigs. ">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Vicky Pebsworth - She serves on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization that has widely been criticized as a source of vaccine misinformation.

Martin Kulldorff - After refusing the COVID-19 vaccine while in a teaching position, he pushed for relaxing COVID-19 restrictions for low risk groups at the height of the pandemic which is an unethical public health practice.

Retsef Levi - He has admitted, himself, that he has minimal vaccine experience yet he publicly wrote inaccurately that the mRNA vaccine causes death.

Robert W. Malone - He has incorrectly suggested that the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could worsen infection.

Kennedy Jr., have publicly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines, promoted debunked conspiracy theories, and aligned themselves with anti-science movements. It is also unclear to the p...

Since it’s original the ACIP has been more than an advisory group to the Secretary. It has been the body that set down recommendations on vaccine schedules for children and adults. determined the strains to be used in the flu vaccine each year, over saw any adverse vaccine effects and generally addressed any vaccine issues that may arise.
I am fearful that the new ACIP is being filled by members who are anti-vaccine or who might delay the introduction of favorable vaccines for personal viewpoints.

Even those who might not be as susceptible to severe illness can still catch the virus and pass it along to others. At best, this increase in infections would lead to decreased productivity at work, which cannot be any good for the economy. At worst, it will cause higher-risk individuals to contract and develop more serious cases in spite of their due caution and responsibly taking the latest vaccine when they need it.

It was not long ago when people across the political spectrum, including the then-former and now-again President, openly embraced the COVID vaccine and vaccines in general. Let us restore that level of unity in attitude and action to stymie infectious disease for our own sake, for that of our fellow Americans, and for our country, economy and all. Let the experts - from people&#039;s own primary care doctors outward - do what they have done for decades to that end and with great success.">Waning immunity from COVID, in particular, reaffirms the importance of up-to-date boosters on at least an annual basis.

A lowered percentage of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines means a trip to the grocery store becomes significantly more dangerous, and the lack of empathy and care to keep everyone safe is appalling. 

I urge the following: 

 RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.

    Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.

 ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

 ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.

 ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

The COVD vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, and to lower one’s chances of dying from COVID. It is critical that mothers, young children, and the community at large have access to this vaccine if they so choose. 

RFK Jr. is running through the health department with a hacksaw and ripping out any information and any experts who stand in his way — at a time when trust in medicine is already at a low. This is not how a government agency should be run.

There is so much research on the danger of Covid, over 500,000 studies. In an article published 10/09/2024 by the American Heart Association, author Laura Williamson said &quot;even for people who just tested positive but did not necessarily develop severe symptoms, the risk of cardiovascular disease was twice as high.

In an article published in the Institute for New Economic Thinking, author Lynn Paramore interviewed Dr. Phillip Alvelda, a former program manager in DARPA&#039;s Biological Technologies Office, who warned that contrary to public belief, Covid is not like the flu but rather is a &quot;multi-dimensional threat impacting brain function, attacking almost all of the body&#039;s organs, producing elevated risks of all kinds, and weakening our ability to fight off other diseases.&quot; Dr. Alvelda went on to predict that at the curr...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. I don’t understand how *limiting* access allows people to continue making their own educated choices for themselves and their families. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health and takes away choice. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vacci... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I have always considered myself fortunate to live when I do — when we have the scientific advancements available to support long, healthy lives and avoid needless suffering and death.

I am gravely concerned about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly removing all 17 of independent expert scientists and clinicians who made up the CDC ACIP committee.

ACIP has had a long history of full public disclosure of any and all potential conflicts of interest, and there should be a complete accounting of all financial conflicts of interest for each new member, confirmed by an independent auditing agency.

If the ACIP committee intends to revisit approval of already approved vaccines, the public deserves to hear the reasoning and see the data that supports re-reviewing vaccines that have been given for decades.

Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial for access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines as well as guide insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program. As a pediatrician who has worked overseas, I have seen illness and death from vaccine-preventable illnesses because of lack of access to vaccines. I am disheartened that we see our communities in the U.S. affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID because of lower than recommended vaccine uptake. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines, and we have already seen this happen with measles in the current outbreak. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

I am very concerned about the recent termination of all the members of  the CDC 
ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  These members  had important roles as expert  scientists or clinicians who could give  unbiased advice about vaccinations. 
I am worried that we will all regret the damage being done to trust in vaccines and their formulation and updating.  Many childhood diseases which were controlled by intelligent vaccination programs may now reemerge (eg.measles and others). Do we really want to see polio, pertussis, mumps and more return in force?  This will be costly both in pain/death and dollars.  Shingles which can be serious, and certainly painful, has recently occurred in my family. The useful vaccine now  available did not exist 35+ years ago.  Let’s continue important research and support science in this field. 

I strongly urge Secretary Kennedy and his department to reconsider their actions before more long-term damage is done.

Comment submitted with respect and hope…

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, hepatitis A, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies... [truncated]">To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Stay healthy means getting vaccinated. It prevents serious illness or even death from occurring. Personally, vaccines help me maintain a healthy and stable lifestyle and wellbeing. It also makes it easier for me to keep my attendance to my work or other events possible. If I’m sick I have to call out of work or cancel plans. If I’m healthy and well, I can stick to my commitments. There’s also the added savings to staying healthy compared to the expense risks and expenses of being sick and with some of the illnesses going around, disabled. Please expand access to vaccination to all ages and people. 

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.
Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pr... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I am writing to support freedom of access for my family to get access to all vaccines recommended by our family drs for generations .  As a dr myself I am very worried about the spread of prevenrable diseases like measles, covid, polio etc that can take a toll if you block vaccine access.  

RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors and bypass his policies limiting access to COVID vaccines.
Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

She has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation. Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He’s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.”

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available w... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

1. The science is completely settled. Thimerosal in vaccines has been proven safe and effective over and over (and over!) again. Its use in multi-dose vials is a cost-effective way to make flu vaccines safely available. 

2. Thimerosal has already been removed from all pediatric flu vaccine, and from all single-dose presentations of adult flu vaccines. Only 2 formulations of flu vaccine are available in multi-dose vials containing thimerosal as a preservative. If a patient wants to avoid thimerosal, they can choose a different flu vaccine presentation.

I also want them to receive regular COVID-19 immunizations, which Secretary Kennedy now wants to restrict to Americans over 65. 

It is vital that the following policies be maintained at the CDC:
1. Secretary Kennedy must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
2. Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
3. ACIP must understand and acknowledge that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective for children, adults, and pregnant women, all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage. Without CDC ACIP recommendations, most insurers will not cover the cost of vaccines.
4. ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
5. ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant women, at least twice annually.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

These covid vaccines are not vaccines, they are gene altering shots, they have killed people, turbo cancers are off the charts, children and teenagers are having strokes and heart attacks; myocarditis, pericarditis, are you kidding!!!!! These were made to harm and kill people, these must be taken off the market along with all the new mRNA and saMRNA vaccines.
Remove them all NOW!">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

To Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
CC:  Senators Alexandro Padilla, Adam Schiff, and Congressman Jimmy Panetta

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I write to express my grave concerns about the termination of all members of the CDC ACIP committee, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  These members played an important role as independent and expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee, with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines.  This impacts ALL of us in this country, through their guidance of insurance coverage, and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program.
Currently, communities across the US are affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.  Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health.  Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

I attest that I have no financial stake in any vaccine manufacturers. I am a General Education college instructor and the parent of a young adult with an autoimmune disease and the daughter of a Vietnam veteran who has, so far, survived two kinds of cancer. I am deeply disturbed by the recent purging of the ACIP committee members on the false premise that they are unduly influenced by “big pharma.” Anyone can do a search on these members at openpaymentsdata.cms.gov and see that none of them or their institutions have received enormous kickbacks from vaccine-making companies. Or you could search the big vaccine makers to see their top recipients, none of whom are on the committee.

Our whole family has relied on easy access to the yearly COVID vaccine to help protect these two at-risk loved ones. By making sure everyone around them gets vaccinated every year, we&#039;ve been able to keep them safe. But with the new recently published proposed FDA policy titled “An Evidence-Based Approach to Covid-19 Vaccination” (NEJM, May 20, 2025), and the recommendation that pediatricians be involved in our decision to vaccinate, some of our family members—like my teenager, who is in a crowded, high-exposure public high school setting every day—might not be able to get the vaccine to help keep her sibling and favorite grandparent safe. This is very troubling to our family because actual evidence from a real study suggests 70% of community spread of viruses is driven by schools.1

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Additionally:
No vaccine on the market has had legitimate safety and efficacy testing. Any high school graduate can see that by reading the studies. Frankly, they should all be pulled as they are reckless. Now, will you listen to the comments or just keep rubber stamping for Big Pharma profits? LOOK at the death and maiming the covid shots have caused.

Hello, I work on the front lines of healthcare as an RN reviewing hospital charts for admissions that enter through the ER. Since the start of the Covid vaccine, I am seeing things I have never seen before in the entire 41 yrs that I have been an RN. I am seeing younger patients (those less than age 60) having ischemic strokes and myocardial infarctions. When carotid ultrasounds are done, the result is often complete occlusion of cerebral arteries. The only explanation for such widespread phenomenon in such a young demographic has to be the white amyloid clots as seen in the documentary &quot;Died Suddenly&quot;. Thrombectomies are common. Another thing I am seeing widespread since the start of the Covid vaccine are extensive blood clots that run from the groin down the length of the patient&#039;s leg. Generally, multiple different veins are occluded, and again, thrombectomies are common. I am also seeing so many seizures coming into the ER, that I lost a mental count on quantity years ago. Some of the seizures are so severe that they cannot be broken with the usual meds and require extreme measures such as intubating and placing the patient on a vent. Another neurological disorder I am seeing an uptick in is new diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. All that being said, by far the most extreme change in diagnosis I am witnessing in real time is the advent of Turbo Cancers, very aggressive and widespread cancer at initial diagnosis.

Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also sow uncertainty and doubt about COVID vaccines, while there...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am a physician and mother of three young children. 

As a physician, I am keenly aware of the life-threatening diseases that my colleagues and I rarely see today because of vaccinations. I am referring to polio, congenital rubella syndrome, diphtheria, and Hib, among others. Previous generations of physicians saw children die from epiglottitis, encephalitis, and bacterial meningitis, and suffer permanent disability from polio. 

Unfortunately, due to anti vaccine sentiment, I am hearing from pediatrician colleagues that infants too young to be vaccinated are coming in with pertussis, in some cases critically ill and requiring ICU level care. This is not because their parents chose not to vaccinate, but because the babies were too young to be vaccinated and were exposed to children whose parents made dangerous decisions. This is a direct consequence of declining herd immunity, which is alarming. It is not limited to pertussis - this is merely one example. We are terrified to face devastating illnesses that we have minimal experience treating due to the luxury of vaccination. 

 As a mother, I don’t believe that most vaccine-hesitant parents want to put their child or others at risk. I believe they are misled by misinformation and lack understanding of how to access or comprehend digestible, evidence-based information.  The rising anti-vaccine sentiment will continue to be devastating, and one child deat... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024-0001

Docket: CDC-2025-0024

June 11, 2025

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns. Especially foundational vaccines such as MMR. There was not an MMR vaccine available when I was a child in the 1960s. And I had no protection from the mumps and developed encephalitis. A very real concern with childhood diseases or after contracting the flu, like the severe flu season we just experienced in 2024-2025. 

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which m... [truncated]">

I am a concerned individual from Oregon writing to you for universal access to vaccines.  When vaccines are strongly advised by the CDC, people are healthier and not hospitalized as often.  This also allows vaccines being covered by health insurance plans, making them accessible to the public. Vaccine access is key for a healthier population.

 1. Everyone needs to be able to access the covid vaccines, they need to be universally available for 6 months age and up.

 2. Immunocompromised individuals need to continue to be allowed a covid vaccine every 2 months having booster access as needed.

 3. We need the elderly, 65+ years of age to receive at least 3 covid vaccination a year.

 4. We need to update the covid vaccine frequency.  As you are aware, the average  active immunity nearly completely wanes within 3-4 months after receiving it with memory immunity at that point. The natural solution to this is to get a covid vaccine every 3-4 months. 

 5. We need to update the covid vaccine formula every 6 months as opposed to once every year. We have been allowing it to mutate and evolve exponentially faster.  Covid is not just seasonal since there are summer and winter waves. We need to utilize the speed of mRNA technology to update the vaccines at a faster rate to keep covid in check. 

Let’s make sure we are promoting optimal health for all populations. Remember, being responsible by utilizing  guidance backed by peer r... [truncated]">Thank you for considering my covid-19 vaccine concerns.

However, it lacks specific stances on vaccine policy and addresses logistical matters rather than expressing clear positions on the ACIP committee membership or COVID-19 vaccines.</td>

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Children with many illnesses they cannot prevent, such as cancer, lupus and inflammatory bowel disease, will especially be put at risk for dying if the general public stops receiving vaccines regularly as recommended by doctors and vaccine experts, because they sometimes cannot tolerate vaccines themselves while on immunosuppresant medications. Their survival rely on that the majority of people are fully vaccinated to avoid death by severe, vaccine-preventable infections. Their lives are priceless. It is absolutely wrong to deprive them from the current safe environment by disrupting vaccination routines. ">I am deeply concerned about the future of our country’s health and access to vaccines.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 

The ACIP committee has a crucial role in assessing the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Their recommendations also guide decisions made by insurance companies about insurance coverage. 

Vaccines play a vital role in preventing serious diseases. While the focus is often on children, I have spent 25 years working with cancer patients and must draw attention to how critical it is to prevent illness in those undergoing cancer treatment and in cancer survivors. As just one example, those who receive bone marrow transplants often lose all previous immunity to illness. They need to have the option to be safely vaccinated in order to regain immunity to life-threatening illnesses. 

In saying this, I don’t want to minimize the importance in other people. Vaccine-preventable diseases can cause death and lifelong health problems in all groups of people, including children. Everyone should have access to effective vaccines that are covered by insurance.

It is imperative that this committee is composed of qualified professional scientists—such as epidemiologists, immunologists, pediatricians, and public health experts—who possess the necessary expertise to assess scientific data, understand disease dynamics, and evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness. Their rigorous training and experience ensure that decisions are informed by the best available evidence, free from misinformation or political influence.

Vaccines are one of the most effective tools in preventing infectious diseases, reducing complications, and saving lives. They protect not only individuals but also communities by establishing herd immunity, especially for those who are most vulnerable, such as infants, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems. To maintain public health and promote equity, it is essential that vaccines remain accessible to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status, geography, or background. Ensuring broad access to vaccines helps prevent outbreaks, reduce healthcare costs, and strengthen societal resilience against preventable diseases.

By entrusting the ACIP to qualified scientists and upholding vaccine accessibility for all, we affirm our commitment to science-driven policy and the health and well-being of every community.">The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plays a critical role in safeguarding public health by developing evidence-based vaccine recommendations.

If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to c... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Further, the new unilaterally unqualified additions to ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest, as public record shows there are many. These new members, many of whom have well earned their disgraces, MUST maintain the status quo: that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective for children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Hello, 

I am writing because long before the pandemic, I went down a rabbit hole learning about vaccines and infectious diseases. Spillover by David Quammen was amazing. I think in away some of the reading and viewing I did before the pandemic prepared me in a way other lay people around weren&#039;t. What I wasn&#039;t prepared for was my husband getting Long Covid. Our lives have been turned upside down. I would not wish this disease on anyone. Anecdotal evidence shows that re-infection can make Long Covid symptoms worse. Everyone in our household gets a yearly Covid booster to protect someone we love very much from having an even lower quality of life. I am concerned that the way current policy is going that I my insurance will not cover my children&#039;s shots or I may have to drive to Canada to get them. 

I just read today that pregnant people infected with SARS-CoV-2 during their first trimester were more likely to have smaller newborns and that children and adolescents who had severe COVID-19 had about three times higher odds of self-harm, suicidal ideation and poisoning compared to those without COVID-19. Both of these things seem worth preventing with vaccines. 

Thank you. ">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Access to vaccines for influenza and COVID-19 is vitally important for the general public because it provides a powerful tool for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, protecting not only those who are vaccinated but also vulnerable individuals who cannot receive vaccines due to age, medical conditions, or compromised immune systems. This collective protection reduces the overall incidence of diseases, lessening the burden on healthcare systems and preventing outbreaks that could overwhelm hospitals. By preventing illness, vaccines also contribute to economic stability, as healthy populations are more productive and less likely to miss work or school due to illness. 

Ultimately, equitable access to vaccines is a cornerstone of public health, safeguarding communities and fostering a healthier, more resilient society for everyone.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsur...

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plays a critical role in safeguarding public health, and I appreciate the committee’s commitment to evaluating data on safety, efficacy, and population needs.
Vaccines have consistently demonstrated their ability to prevent serious illness, reduce hospitalizations, and save lives. From long-standing vaccines such as those for influenza, HPV, and meningococcal disease, to newer vaccines for COVID-19 and RSV, each has been subject to extensive clinical trials and real-world surveillance. These interventions not only protect individuals but also contribute to community immunity, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations such as infants, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions.
I urge the committee to continue supporting recommendations based on robust data and to ensure that the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program includes access to all ACIP-recommended vaccines. Equitable access and clear, evidence-based guidelines are essential in maintaining public trust and improving health outcomes nationwide.

It is vital that everyone who can vaccinate against COVID continue to do so, to prevent cases of infection that could potentially lead to death or the immune and neurological damage known as &quot;long COVID.&quot; In addition, the more people vaccinate against COVID, the less likely people who genuinely cannot vaccinate are to become infected. Herd immunity simply does not work without vaccines.

We have also seen alarming effects of lack of vaccination in other diseases. The outbreaks of measles in anti-vaccination communities around the country are a prime example.

It is imperative that the CDC not give in to the demands of extreme right-wing political figures at the expense of the safety and health of the general public.

I am especially concerned because my niece is having a baby this year and she can&#039;t get a vaccine for herself to protect her baby before it&#039;s born. The President wants people to have a lot more babies, but you have to let parents vaccinate their kids (if they want to) if you want to increase the number of babies in this country! Respect their freedom to get vaccines, make the vaccines available for everyone, and you can expect happy parents who will support you. But until then you are losing support from all the parents who love their kids and want to vaccinate them -- that&#039;s a lot of parents!!!

This vaccine has protected my family during the pandemic with an infant and it continues to do so during my most recent pregnancy this year. I also have a 5 year old entering kindergarten this year who has received it and am thankful for the protection he&#039;ll have. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to update... [truncated]">I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

access to the COVID vaccine especially Novavax has been essential in helping me and my community mitigate harm caused the continued spread of COVID. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

June 17, 2025

to: The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)

I am writing to express serious concerns about recent developments impacting vaccine policy and the ACIP committee. I have no conflicts of interest to declare. Specifically, I am troubled by the termination of all 17 ACIP committee members on June 9, as announced by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

Independent expert scientific and medical guidance from the ACIP is essential for determining access to safe and effective FDA-approved vaccines. This guidance also informs insurance coverage and the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many diseases are dangerously low, leading to outbreaks of preventable illnesses such as measles, pertussis, and COVID-19. These diseases can have severe, long-term consequences, especially for unvaccinated individuals. No child should suffer or die due to lack of access to affordable vaccines. Strong, effective vaccination campaigns are vital. I personally recall the devastating impact of measles and polio before vaccines were available, and the relief when those vaccines arrived.

The recent limitations placed on COVID-19 vaccinations are particularly concerning. Universal access to updated COVID-19 vaccines, covered by health insurance, is crucial. Scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination within the past year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe illness, disability, and death for all age groups, includ...

This person is valuable and important to me, their family, and the community. COVID vaccinations for ALL help limit infection, reduce transmissability and improve the general level of health for everyone--but especially benefit those who would suffer immensely or lose their life to COVID if infected. We ALL can choose whether to vaccinate, but those who care for the well-being of people them may not even know--society at large--need to be able to choose to protect others and themselves. CDC, FDA and DHS have a responsibility to educate on the value of vaccines in general to save lives and improve health. Just surviving an infection is good--but the long lasting effects of the infection could prove deadly weeks, months or a few years later. This has been shown with many viral diseases and is readily apparent with the COVID infections rampaging year round. Long COVID is devastating the health and productivity of the population. Children get Long COVID as well as adults. We are creating generations of people who are far less likely to reach their physical and mental potential. Many will die of secondary issues that could be prevented with vaccination and health agencies need to fund the development of  more effective vaccines that could induce mucosal immunity.

I specifically support continued access to safe, effective vaccines and oppose recommendations based on scientifically unfounded concerns (such as those about thimerosal, which have been debunked time and again).

Thimerosal Safety is Well-Established:
The scientific consensus on thimerosal safety is overwhelming. Multiple large-scale studies involving millions of people, including children, have found no credible evidence linking thimerosal-containing vaccines to autism or developmental delays. The Institute of Medicine, CDC, FDA, and major medical organizations worldwide have consistently affirmed thimerosal&#039;s safety profile. This evidence includes studies from Denmark, the UK, the US (among others) involving over 1.5 million children, continued autism rates after thimerosal removal from childhood vaccines, and decades of safe use with robust safety monitoring.

Ease of Access to Vaccines is Critical for Public Health:
Vaccines represent one of the greatest public health achievements in human history. Any policy reducing vaccine availability poses significant risks to community health, particularly for vulnerable populations including infants too young to be vaccinated, immunocompromised individuals, elderly adults, and communities with lower vaccination rates. Vaccines are one of the ways a country keeps its citizens health...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F.

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

In my own life, I have seen vaccines help to preserve the health and wellness of my father, significant other, and friends, keeping them out of the hospital when they had COVID and allowing them not to suffer the virus’s worst effects.  Without a vaccine, their outcomes could have been much worse and perhaps fatal.

This decision is not only reckless and dangerous—it is a direct attack on our public health infrastructure, not just in the United States, but globally. Diseases do not respect borders, political ideologies, or conspiracy theories. What happens here reverberates across the world.

The ACIP is not a political tool. It is a scientifically grounded, life-saving advisory body composed of experts whose sole mission is to protect lives through evidence-based vaccine guidance. These members serve with dedication, ethics, and public accountability. Stripping them away dismantles trust, creates chaos, and endangers millions.

Whatever happened to allowing people to make their own informed choices? By eliminating the ACIP and silencing expert voices, you are not promoting freedom—you are removing choice entirely. You are denying the public access to clear, science-based information and replacing it with confusion and control. That is not health freedom. That is authoritarianism disguised as reform.

I am someone whose life was nearly lost because one physician failed to give me a single recommended vaccine. I contracted bacterial meningitis—something that could have been prevented. I survived. I am one of the lucky ones. But so many others weren’t. The work ACIP does literally saves lives. Undermining it will cost them.

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine acces... [truncated]">Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Hello my name is Aseera. Without vaccine access I would not be alive today. I almost died of an e.coli infection in 2010 and since then my immune system hasn&#039;t been the same. I was a young vegetarian who exercised very regularly and had no previous major illness before eating something that was contaminated with e.coli. Anyone can become vulnerable. Everyone will eventually become disabled. 

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a ...

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my horror at the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective, science-backed vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies impose harmful restrictions on COVID vaccines, which limit vaccine access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These... [truncated]">To the CDC ACIP committee:

CDC ACIP should represent the gold standard in evidence-based, apolitical recommendations. Instead, the HHS secretary has done exactly what he promised not to do during confirmation: purge career experts in favor of unqualified individuals who seek to gain personal advancement and power by seeding doubt and confusion about proven vaccine science. This will kill people. This will make people sick, especially children, as we have already seen with recent outbreaks. The chilling effect on vaccine uptake is already hurting people; this group must represent a bulwark against vaccine backsliding so that we can follow real science as led by actual experts. Diseases live in the objective, evidence-based world, and they will not stop because of a political shift.

I have a personal experience with meningitis.  In February of 2019, my son, Joseph was in his first year of college in San Luis Obispo, California when he contracted meningococcal meningitis serogroup B and died within a few hours of the onset of symptoms. I thought Joseph was fully protected because he was immunized with the meningitis ACWY vaccine. It wasn’t until after his death that I learned he was not fully protected. Joseph had never been immunized with the meningitis B vaccine and our family had no idea the vaccine even existed.

I strongly urge 1) the administration to clarify how the ACIP will be reconstituted, including how recently announced members have been selected, and to provide clear assurance that the ACIP will continue to be guided by science, transparency, and meaningful public input; and 2) that new members become informed on the critical issues affecting meningococcal meningitis in the U.S. today and why immediate action is needed.  
 
No one should have to experience that horrific disease, which can take a life within hours and has a 10% mortality rate, even with treatment. This und...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:
I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
I am writing to express grave concerns about Robert F. Kennedy, Jr’s termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee. These former members had an important role as independent expert scientists and clinicians with a crucial role in providing their expert understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines guiding policies for childhood vaccination through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are currently low, and many communities across the US are experiencing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID.  All of these infections can cause serious short-term and long-term illness and death.  That children in the US would be denied access to effective vaccines (which these are all proven to be) in the year 2025 is truly unimaginable.  
I also have concerns about the policies that have been established that limit access to COVID vaccinations and create confusion around who should or could receive them--despite robust evidence that all of the COVID vaccines are safe and effective. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently infecting a quarter million people a day in the US, resulting in rising numbers of people (including children) suffering from long COVID with as many as 1000 excess...

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Deaths from the Covid shots are only the tip of the iceberg as far as reactions from the Covid shots.

It is my opinion and backed by research that these vaccines do more harm than they do good.  I personally know several people who have had adverse reactions after taking these vaccines and boosters including getting Covid shortly after taking the vaccine as well as others who have had a multitude of new illnesses after getting the covid vaccines. These people are so sorry that they took the vaccines but it is too late now! It&#039;s time to STOP these vaccines which are only helping the pharmacy companies get rich while people are dying!

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns. I am old enough to remember classmates and neighbors who were left with long term consequences from measles and polio. We celebrated when these vaccines became available. 

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the ri... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. I have a three year old son and I am very concerned that on top of so many things to worry about for his health and safety and that of his community, I fear we are now going backwards and enabling preventable diseases to harm, maim and kill children. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

I appreciate the opportunity to submit this written testimony to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. As a stem cell transplant physician, I have witnessed firsthand the life-saving power of vaccination in a population rendered profoundly immunocompromised by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Following HSCT, patients lose nearly all preexisting immunity and are exquisitely vulnerable to infection, necessitating a structured vaccination protocol beginning approximately three months post-transplant with inactivated vaccines including COVID‑19, influenza, and pneumococcal agents to mitigate infection-related morbidity and mortality. The serologic response to COVID‑19 vaccines in HSCT recipients is attenuated, with initial two-dose series yielding suboptimal immunity; however, additional doses dramatically boost seroconversion rates—reaching &gt;87% after three doses and &gt;90% after a fourth. Despite these gains, HSCT patients remain at significant risk for severe disease and death from SARS‑CoV‑2—emphasizing the critical role of booster doses. Tragically, within the past month, two of my HSCT patients were admitted to the ICU with vaccine-preventable viral illnesses, and one did not survive. This is an outcome that could potentially have been prevented by vaccination.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a similarly grave risk: HSCT recipients face nearly 80% progression to pneumo... [truncated]">Amar Kelkar, MD, MPH, FACP

For the sake of me, my family, all of our friends and loved ones, we must actively seek to make our disease response systems more robust, and certainly not erode the protections we do already have.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases b...

I know multiple people who&#039;ve suffered severe side effects from the COVID shots, and all tried to report it to their doctors.  In every case, the doctors refused to submit reports or even acknowledge that the shots were responsible for the side effects, including those that are obviously attributable to the &quot;vaccines&quot; that do not prevent infection or transmission.  

What happened during the COVID pandemic was criminal, and we need to ensure it will never happen again.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">All vaccines should be thoroughly tested, and they should be recommended, NEVER mandated.

Reducing vaccine access because a group is deemed &quot;not at high risk&quot; even though we are well aware of the ways COVID-19 damages the immune system of any individual (the virus doesn&#039;t care who you are) is just ridiculous to me. This is like saying your car doesn&#039;t need a lock on it anymore because no one has been able to successfully steal it. Now your car is vulnerable to theft because it doesn&#039;t have the protection given by the lock. A simple analogy, but I hope it gets my point across.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove ABSOLUTELY ALL  currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing.

I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all...

I am writing to today in support of continued access for ALL to the COVID vaccine, which is FDA approved and is proven effective at reducing severe illness, death and Long COVID. As COVID continues to decimate the health of millions of Americans, restricting access to the vaccine would further the negative effects of the pandemic on public health, ESPECIALLY for children and pregnant people.  

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.

As we continue to see long COVID and other COVID complications arise in the years since the beginning of the COVID outbreak, creating barriers to vaccine access will only contribute to worsening outcomes and severe disease. The vaccines have been crucial in reducing the number of acute infections and hospitalization.

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market.

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025 CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Dear CDC ACIP committee:

On behalf of the National Council on Aging (NCOA), I am writing to express our concerns about the recent termination of all the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) committee members, announced on June 9th. Input from the ACIP committee is critical to informing access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines.  As we are in the midst of peak 65 with roughly 11,400 Americans turning 65 every day, it is critical that organizations like NCOA has access to expert and research informed data as it relates to health recommendations for older adults. At NCOA, we encourage older adults to prioritize vaccinations to protect their health due to weakened immune system that occur naturally.  We rely on expert recommendations from federal experts such as the ACIP committee to provide recommendations to use so that we can appropriately provide guidance to America’s seniors to ensure seniors continue to stay healthy. As a committee that includes professionals such public health officials, pediatricians, and epidemiologist, these are the experts that should be seated on this committee.  In the past the National Council on Aging has been called on by the ACIP to provide guidance on issues related to senior health.  We would encourage Secretary Kennedy to re-instate the ACIP Advisory Committee.

Vaccines are a valuable scientific development; while not being entirely perfect, all the time, for everyone, there is good work being done by clear-eyed, thoughtful scientists who seek to serve the greater good through medical advancement. To reject support for vaccines wholesale is as absurd as it is to have blind faith in all vaccines. Our Hippocratic oath and the charge to &quot;do no harm&quot; does what it is supposed to for doctors to be knowledgeable resources of information for their patients, who in turn have the right to make their own reasoned decision about their bodies and their health risks. For example, I myself have a hearing condition that made a doctor recommend I not get the second MMR booster as a child; that same doctor, and every doctor since, has also encouraged periodic immunity testing to ensure that I remain protected from MMR diseases today. And, as science has advanced and vaccines along with it, the concerns that were felt when I was a child are no longer applied to children with my condition today, because medicine has advanced. I protest and strongly urge against efforts to wipe out a trusted, experienced team of scientists and regulators...

I have taken care of many children suffering from vaccine preventable disease, many of whom suffered severe long term consequences and/or death. 

Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidenc... [truncated]">To the CDC ACIP committee:

   So what changed between 1976 and now, when almost 40,000 people have already died due to mRNA shot??  So many young people have &quot;Suddenly dropped dead&quot;. Does it take having your own child drop dead in order to get rid of these deadly shots?  
   I believe the difference between 1976 &amp; now, is how &quot;captured&quot; the decision makers are, by big Pharma. Lets just make it right NOW!   
     And are we going to wait until Austistic  children are 1 out of 2 births?  There are NO studies that look for the results of putting 74+ shots into each kid. That is totally insane!  It is time to take the power away from big Pharma... [truncated]">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

I suffer from severe asthma, which puts me already at a higher risk of complications from respiratory viruses—especially COVID. Vaccines are crucial for preventing me from becoming very sick and compromising my lungs health. I strongly believe that vaccines should be available (in most, if not all, pharmacies and community health centers) and accessible (at a low price and 100% covered by insurance). Everyone who chooses to be vaccinated based on personal need and guidance from health professionals deserves to have access. 

Therefore, I, as a tax-paying citizen of the USA, demand:

	1	RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process with CDC’s ACIP and reverse the decision to remove the recent expert advisors.
	2	Members of ACIP must disclose all financial and other conflicts of interest.
	3	ACIP must understand that currently available FDA-approved vaccines are safe and effective, and children, adults, and pregnant people all of whom rely on CDC ACIP vaccine recommendations for access to vaccines and insurance coverage.
	4	ACIP must continue to recommend widespread and unhindered access to a wide range of vaccines to protect people of all ages in the US.
	5	ACIP must preserve a universal recommendation for COVID vaccines for people of all ages, including children and pregnant people, at least twice annually.

As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing.

I have a medical background - roughly 20 years in emergency medicine.  I also read the peer reviewed published literature.  You want the public to trust you? Do your part and stop recommending products that have not been properly tested.  Do your part and make clear when benefits do not justify the risks.  Stop recommending products with serious reported issues.  If you don&#039;t like VAERS, recommend something better to replace it.
Take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. By extension, this should apply to ALL vaccines.
