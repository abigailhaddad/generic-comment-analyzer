  ],
  "stance_indicators": {
    "Opposition to COVID-19 Vaccines (Call for Removal)": "remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market; destroy the deadly vaccines; get rid of these vaccines; these vaccines cause more harm than good; deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; comparing to swine flu vaccine recall; urge ACIP to take a stance for public health by pulling COVID vaccines; routine and repeated COVID shots should stop; evidence is clear, remove COVID shots; toxins knowingly placed in these injections to harm",
    "Support for Continued/Broad Access to COVID-19 Vaccines": "keep COVID-19 vaccines available to everyone; protect access to covid 19 vaccines; do not restrict the Covid vaccine; please don't take it away; vaccines save lives; vaccines should be covered by insurance; COVID vaccine has proven to be safe and effective; need access for high-risk/disabled/immunocompromised people; demand full access to all healthcare including vaccines; please keep all Vaccines available to whom ever would like to do so",
    "Support for Science-Based, Independent ACIP Committee": "grave/serious concerns about the recent termination of all 17 ACIP committee members; independent expert scientific and medical input is crucial; oppose replacement with unqualified or anti-vaccine figures; RFK Jr. must preserve an independent decision process; committee must be made up of experienced, qualified people; removal of previous members harms public health; demand restoration of former ACIP members; distrust of politically-motivated removals; platforming of pseudoscience profiteers; calls for transparency and conflict of interest disclosures",
    "Opposition to Restricting Vaccine Access/Eligibility (including Children and High-Risk)": "oppose unnecessary restrictions placed on COVID vaccinations; do not change vaccine policies that would make vaccines more difficult to access; setting restrictions on vaccines is not only unnecessary, it's anti-science; universal or broad access is necessary; removal or restriction would endanger vulnerable groups; insurance should cover vaccines for all ages; keep covid vaccines on the recommended schedule; Novavax (non mRNA) should be approved for all ages and covered",
    "Opposition to Politicization/Delegitimization of Vaccine Policy": "RFK Jr. has politicized science; political shenanigans; politics should not make this decision; removal/appointment of ACIP members for political, not scientific, reasons; keep the committee apolitical; must be actual experts, not political appointees; government interference in public health",
    "Support for Vaccine-Preventable Disease Protection and Broad Immunization Policy": "vaccines are a proven way out of polio, measles, covid, etc.; broad access to all FDA-approved and recommended vaccines; keep access to vaccines for all vaccine-preventable diseases; importance of vaccination for community health, children, workplace, school safety; calls to keep or expand coverage through Vaccines for Children and insurance; concerns about declining vaccination rates and outbreaks"
