I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Before I got covid I was running half marathons and was training for a full marathon. After I got covid now I can only walk a few thousand steps per day and have trouble climbing stairs. I can’t run at all. Long covid has drastically reduced my quality of life. And no, this isn’t vaccine side-effects because I developed long covid in 2021, before I ever got a vaccine.

Also pulling vaccines is bad for the economy. Before I got covid I literally never took a sick day from work. When I got infected with covid at age 33, I was so sick I was unable to work for a year. I am still limited in what jobs I can apply for since I can’t work as physically demanding of a job as I worked before (I was a cook). This can happen to anyone, and the chance of you developing long covid goes up with each new infection that you get. An estimated 4 million people are out of work sick with long covid. You can’t afford to ignore this, soon hardly anyone will be healthy enough to work.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I&#039;m writing to express my concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 
The ACIP committee is extremely important because it provides independent and scientifically accurate oversight, as well as understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences. Children should not be becoming disabled by and even dying from diseases because they can&#039;t access affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations, creating barriers that are harmful to public health. Everyone must have access to updated COVID vaccines that are widely available and fully covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to s... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I appreciate the opportunity to provide public comment on the COVID-19 vaccines for the 2025-2026 cycle.

As an immunocompromised senior, having access to safe and effective vaccines is vital. Initially, I chose the mRNA Moderna series, but after switching to the Protein Subunit Novavax vaccine, I had a much better experience—avoiding the three-day malaise I experienced with Moderna. My research indicates that Novavax offers greater durability and reduced reactogenicity, allowing for fewer and more spaced-out doses. However, inconsistent communication regarding availability has been challenging.

To improve public health, I urge you to consider the following recommendations:

- Maintain a universal vaccination recommendation for all age groups.
- Move the release of vaccines to summer, given the ongoing risks from variants.
- Ensure full insurance coverage with no out-of-pocket costs.
- Reinstate the BRIDGE access program.

Thank you for your attention to these important issues.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. I am writing to express my grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 existing CDC ACIP committee members, announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns, including COVID, HPV, influenza, MMR/MMRV, meningococcal, and RSV vaccines.

The recent restrictions on COVID vaccinations are a serious concern. All of us must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines, which must be made available widely and must be covered by health insurance. The scientific evidence is clear: COVID vaccination within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

The FDA must ensure a four-week public comment period before an upcoming committee meeting. One week prior is not enough time for—and effectively preventing—public feedback.

As COVID infections continue to harm public health during this ongoing pandemic, scientific evidence clearly indicates that vaccines remain one of the most important tools for addressing SARS-CoV-2. Universal access to updated COVID vaccines is needed to address the ongoing changes in variants. Additionally, vaccines must be recommended for individuals of all ages and be fully covered by public funds/or insurance at a regular interval of at least every six months.

The vaccine schedule should address waning efficacy in the months following vaccination [1-3] as well as the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains. FDA decisions will affect the current and future vaccine approach, including what healthcare providers recommend, what health insurance covers, and level of public engagement.

Restricting access to these vaccinations, at any level, neglects the responsibility to protect everyone, as anyone is vulnerable to a COVID infection that could lead to severe health outcomes or Long COVID. Given that there is the potential to upda... [truncated]">Docket No. FDA-2025-N-1146

I am a psychotherapist working with students in a university in Ireland. It is shocking to see many young people with adverse reactions to the shots, including myocarditis. There have been many issues in young women, including polycistic ovarian syndrome, hemorrhaging and  an increase in mental health issues, particularly where prescribed synthetic hormones are taken for contraception.
Additionally, there has been am alarming rise in male suicides since the covid injection rollout.

Thank you for all your work!

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

RE: Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

Dear Secretary Kennedy and Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),

I am writing as a concerned citizen with educational training and professional experience in public health as well as lived experience with Long Covid and other infection-associated chronic conditions.

I was deeply troubled by the Secretary’s abrupt termination of the ACIP members earlier this month. I share the concerns expressed by major physicians and public health groups like the American Medical Association and American Public Health Association that this will increase vaccine-preventable diseases–causing avoidable illness and deaths. For example, Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, called the committee a trusted source of science- and data-driven advice and said “Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.”

The Secretary’s action broke the promise he made during confirmation hearings, which undermines trust in his leadership. The committee was composed of qualified, thoughtful experts selected by a rigorous process. I fear their replacements do not live up to these standards. I suggest that the Secretary reads the article published by the former ACIP members in JAMA on June 16, 2025 (Asutrias et al).

Hello, I work on the front lines of healthcare as an RN reviewing hospital charts for admissions that enter through the ER. Since the start of the Covid vaccine, I am seeing things I have never seen before in the entire 41 yrs that I have been an RN. I am seeing younger patients (those less than age 60) having ischemic strokes and myocardial infarctions. When carotid ultrasounds are done, the result is often complete occlusion of cerebral arteries. The only explanation for such widespread phenomenon in such a young demographic has to be the white amyloid clots as seen in the documentary &quot;Died Suddenly&quot;. Thrombectomies are common. Another thing I am seeing widespread since the start of the Covid vaccine are extensive blood clots that run from the groin down the length of the patient&#039;s leg. Generally, multiple different veins are occluded, and again, thrombectomies are common. I am also seeing so many seizures coming into the ER, that I lost a mental count on quantity years ago. Some of the seizures are so severe that they cannot be broken with the usual meds and require extreme measures such as intubating and placing the patient on a vent. Another neurological disorder I am seeing an uptick in is new diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. All that being said, by far the most extreme change in diagnosis I am witnessing in real time is the advent of Turbo Cancers, very aggressive and widespread cancer at initial diagnosis.

I have lost two friends immediately after the Covid Shot!
A third has never been able to exercise w/out breathing problems since the shot. My mom got neuropathy right afterwards and still has it! These shot are dangerous!

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. In 1976, the swine flu vaccine was immediately pulled after approximately 25 people died following vaccination. As of May 30, 2025, there have been 38,666 reports of deaths following COVID vaccination in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, yet this committee continues to recommend routine and repeated COVID shots. Additionally, I urge you to ensure that all vaccines will be subject to gold standard, double-blind inert placebo studies – a process that has not been in place for vaccines – before licensing. If ACIP is ever to regain the trust of the American people, it must start with removing COVID shot recommendations and establishing sound and rigorous research of all vaccines prior to marketing.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

Kennedy, Jr. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is crucial to inform access to safe and effective FDA-approved and authorized vaccines and also to guide insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are impacted by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences in unvaccinated children and adults. Children should not die because of a lack of access to affordable vaccines. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns. I am a physician and trained prior to the use of the HIB vaccine, and distinctly remember the horror of trying to save children from epiglottis and meningitis from what is now a preventable disease process. The lack of herd  immunity for HIB due to poor vaccine uptake in the general public, recently cost a fully vaccinated but immune compromised child his life in this country, an outcome that was not an issue to worry about in the last 30 or more years.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

For everyone, but especially those of us who are disabled, testing positive for Covid-19 puts us at risk for developing long covid and/or one of its many associated health conditions. For me, developing long covid could mean never being able to participate in society in a productive manner or to hold a consistent, full-time job again. It is thanks to the countless hours of thorough and evidence-based research and study by doctors and scientists on vaccines that keep me and my family safer from the potential severe effects of contracting Covid-19. 

We have had vaccines for many different ailments for over a hundred years. I am incredibly grateful to the people whose work has led to their creation. I believe that everyone should be able to easily access ALL vaccines that have evidence-based research for their safety and efficacy. Plenty evidence already exists for the Covid vaccine and there is even more evidence on other older vaccines. 

I am also writing you to share how deeply concerned I am over the termination of all members of the ACIP committee which was announced by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on June 9th. These committee members play an incredibly important role in keeping Americans safe as independent experts in their fields. Additionally, they are needed now more than ever. Vaccination ...

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose. 

As a parent, I will do anything to keep my child safe and healthy. It is imperative that common sense access to vaccinations that have long since been proven safe and effective by many, many studies be preserved for not only my child, but his classmates and all of the adults in his life. COVID-19 has hit our family hard. One of our dear relatives died, and other adults in his life have been affected by long term health effects from the illness. Access to this vaccine--and ALL  proven effective vaccines--is important to us and our well being. It is my wish that, as an American, my child, my family, and myself have access to the best medical care that science has to offer. It would be a tragedy to rip away something that is so standard around the world. We should be the leaders in health care, not a country full of cautionary tales.">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I urge ACIP members to take a firm stance for public health and remove all currently licensed COVID shots from the market. 

My father-in-law died from a hear attack following the COVID Booster and had Covid at that time. I know two people who got turbo cancers and passed away following COVID shots. I know two other family members with sudden heart issues after receiving COVID shots, one is scheduled for heart surgery. Additionally I have a friend who received Covid shots and developed severe auto immune issues that kept her from working and doctors aren&#039;t able to figure out the solution. 

Please do what&#039;s right and remove covid shots from the market...see past any monetary incentives and actually care about the American people. 

Also please do more rigorous testing on all vaccines.

Thank you for your time and review.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?
