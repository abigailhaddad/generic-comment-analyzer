Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it ...

They hardly need additional studies: plenty of scholarly studies have already been conducted. 

These injections have clearly been a massive failure in preventing transmission and infection. These facts alone should be sufficient to ban their use, considering the immense expenses they incurred and the wide-spread lies that were disseminated about their safety and efficacy. 

The most egregious aspect of their use has been the great harms they have caused, including the dozens of potential side effects that their manufacturers were clearly aware of prior to their release but hid from the public. Great harm, including thousands if not millions of unnecessary and premature deaths. Appalling. Evil.

Sometimes even when one wishes to appear scholarly and balanced and unbiased, and project an image in order to avoid being labeled, name-called, ridiculed (which typically happens at the greatest pitch when one is taking the most righteous action), there is so much information already available of such an appalling nature that to do less than shut down this murder before further harm is done would be a terrible dereliction of duty.  
Please don&#039;t drag your proverbial feet. Please bring an end to this scourge.">ACIP – Want to Regain the Public’s Trust?

To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only serve to sow doubt in vaccines. Receiving a COVID vaccine within the last year reduces the risk of symptoms, severe disease, disability, and death for people of all ages, including previously healthy people. The new policies create barriers to access to COVID vaccines, limiting access for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions also create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. We ask you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

When the vaccine was finally authorized for her age group, I felt immense pride. Even this small child was doing her part to contribute to herd immunity and protect our community. That’s why the idea of losing access to these safe and effective vaccines is so distressing.

Long COVID is real. It worsens pre-existing conditions and can create new, sometimes disabling, health problems. We should be doing everything in our power to prevent it—not only for individual health, but for the well-being of our entire society and economy.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I am deeply concerned about the recent removal of all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These individuals are independent experts whose work on ACIP plays a critical role in evaluating the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved vaccines. Their guidance helps determine insurance coverage and supports access through the Vaccines for Children program.

Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available with full coverage by health insurance. The scientific evidence is irrefutable and it is a waste of precious resources and time to conduct additional efficacy studies, which only...

I fear the possibility of further erosion of vaccine recommendations with the recent termination of all 17 CDC ACIP committee members. Independent expert scientific and medical input from the ACIP committee is critical for access to safe and effective vaccines. Vaccination rates for many diseases are far too low, and our communities are experiencing outbreas of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and pertussis, with serious and possibly life-long consequences. We need strong support for effective vaccination campaigns.

Vaccine policy changes must be undertaken in a science-based, open, and transparent process that prioritizes public health. The COVID vaccine policy updates were done in a top-down fashion, without appropriate expert advisory committee input. PFDA’s VRBPAC committee members were not allowed to discuss the COVID vaccine policy changes at the May 22 meeting. There was no opportunity to provide public comment on the new policies before they were implemented. Influenza vaccine strain selection also occurred in a closed-door meeting without input from the FDA VRBPAC committee and with no...

I am alive today thanks to vaccines.  I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are declining, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health.

The ACIP is essential and invaluable in terms of national vaccine policy and keeping all of us safe. More people who are vaccinated, less diseases evolve to harm and kill people in our communities. 

I am writing with concern about first, the firing of the 17 existing members and the selection of new members who have offered false claims about MRNA vaccines—Robert Malone, an anti-Vaccine opponent Vicky Pebsworth of National Vaccine Information Center, and  Great Barrington Declaration author Martin Kulldorf, as well as Retsef Levi and Michael Ross—these members represent dangerous views that harm everyone, and vaccines are one of the most important public safety measures we have.

If we are to live in a community together that means making choices that take care of ourselves and others, which makes a better living environment with more joy and health. 

My concern is that the new members have strong anti-vaccine views, not centered in science and that their recommendations will not be for the best of health for all, but centered in ideologies that are not factual and harmful. 

I want free and accessible COVID vaccines for anyone over 6 months and for pregnant mothers to protect themselves and their children who are most harmed by COVID, a debilitating disease that can have lifelong consequences for mother and child.

Public Comment for the June 25-27, 2025, CDC ACIP Committee Meeting
To RFK Jr. and Members of the CDC ACIP committee:

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. 

Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. 

Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines. COVID vaccines must be available to everyone and not be limited to only some people.
RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations.. Creating such barriers is harmful to the public’s health. Everyone must have regular access to updated COVID vaccines and widely available ... [truncated]">Docket: CDC-2025-0024

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Today, I am writing to express grave concerns about the recent termination of all 17 members of the CDC ACIP committee announced on June 9 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. These former members have an important role as independent expert scientists or clinicians on the ACIP committee with a crucial role in providing their understanding of the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved and authorized vaccines while also guiding insurance coverage and coverage for uninsured children through the Vaccines for Children program. Currently, vaccination rates for many infectious diseases are very low, and many communities across the US are directly affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, pertussis, and COVID. Many of these infections can cause serious and potentially lifelong consequences on their health. Children in 2025 should not die or become disabled from infectious diseases because of a lack of access to affordable and effective vaccines.

Vaccines are a matter of life or death for me, as I am immunocompromised, and can easily be killed by these preventable diseases, this should not be allowed to happen to myself or anyone, and with how COVID affects the body, anyone, healthy or not, can become like me at any point, and be just as vulnerable.

I have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

I was shocked to see the termination of multiple vaccine experts from the ACIP. Please reverse this decision and make sure the ACIP is staffed with qualified experts without financial or other conflicts of interest. As an immunocompromised person (under 65), I need the help of those around me to stay safe. The scientific evidence shows that vaccines are safe and effective. They have saved the lives of multitudes of people and need to be available and covered by insurance. We need only to look to the past to see the beneficial influence of vaccines in preventing serious illness and death. How sad it would be for this country to backtrack on progress that took centuries and much investment of time, treasure, and human lives to attain.

In particular, I am distressed that RFK Jr., Marty Makary, and Vinay Prasad have recently established policies that limit access to COVID vaccinations for children, pregnant people, and adults under age 65. These restrictions create immense confusion among the public on the usefulness of COVID vaccines. We ask you to take action, follow the evidence, and reinstate universal COVID vaccine recommendations for people of all ages, twice a year, for all COVID vaccine formulations.

I beg this committee to ensure that all vaccine policy decisions are considered, evaluated, and concluded using open and transparent processes that rely on scientific evidence.
