This is based on my service as Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2003-2011.

Effectively serving as an Institute and Centers Director (as well as a Division Director below them) requires a large amount of scientific knowledge and experience. Policy development does depends on a strong factual and scientific basis and the priorities for science do not vary rapidly over time. New opportunities and technologies emerge over time and some opportunities become less pressing due to advances. But these events are adequately covered with the existing civil service structure. The NIH Director is a political appointee and is able to communicate priorities of the administration effectively to others at NIH quite effectively, in my experience.

The potential harms from the implementation of Schedule F include rapid turnover of large numbers of key NIH leaders with each new Presidential administration. It takes time to develop the skills and knowledge to effectively function in these complicated jobs and rapid turnover and fear of political, capricious termination over issues not closely connected to science could be quite detrimental to biomedical research progress and effective use of precious taxpayer funds.

If every 4 years there is suddenly the risk that funded projects showing reasonable progress towards their stated goals could be terminated merely because of changes in administration, then investigators are essentially held hostage to the most extreme political opinions on both sides of the spectrum. It goes without saying that each administration will have its research priorities, and those will be reflected in calls for new proposals and the agenda for new funds. This move to make grant-making decisions policy-making decisions at all levels however is a move that politicizes science at exactly a time when the nation would be best served by the opposite instinct. 

This is a move that will ultimately harm everyone&#039;s interests and the public good. Science benefits from stability and continuity in decision making processes. There may be ways to meaningfully streamline grant review. There may even be ways to make the process more responsive to administration priorities as those change, but re-framing scientific grants as policy is deeply misguided.

The proposed policy change is unnecessary. As a union representative in a federal workplace, I have seen my agency effectively use the current performance management and discipline procedures to address poor performance and conduct issues. When these procedures are followed, conduct and performance improve, not sometimes, every time. The current procedures are both more efficient and more cost effective than the proposed change. One of the most expensive actions an employer can take is removal of an employee. The costs, both monetary and temporal, associated with hiring and training a new employee are always higher than the costs of improving performance. Additionally, if performance and conduct management procedures have been followed and do not correct the issues, removal is a simple process. Any management official who thinks removal is a challenging process is admitting they are not an effective manager, and should likely be having their own performance managed. The inefficiency I see in my federal workplace is not the result of poor performance of employees; it is the result of poor performance of management.">OPM Docket OPM-2025-0004 RIN 3206-AO80

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

I am not, and have never been a Federal employee; as a member of the public, however, I recognize the need for and value of the civil service. I am strongly encouraging OPM to uphold the values of a nonpartisan, professional civil service. The current proposed rule runs counter to the spirit of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Given that this is the Act that led to the creation of OPM, I find it sadly ironic OPM has put this proposal forth.  

The Schedule Policy/Career poses a significant threat to the integrity and effectiveness of Federal agencies. It undermines the principles of merit-based employment. Reclassifying career civil servants as appointees and removing job protections will not increase accountability. Instead it will remove a basic constraint against political interference. Civil servants are already held accountable. Studies show politicizing civil service worsens public outcomes and leads to greater inefficiency, waste, and instability. 

Contrary to what has been suggested in a number of mass copy and pasted comments that this measure will bring accountability to the Federal bureaucracy, there have been —and remain— avenues to address performance concerns and misconduct. Career civil servants work in support of public service goals established by agencies. The president already appoints agency heads as well as several positions un... [truncated]">As a tax-paying American citizen, I am writing to urge OPM to rescind the proposed rule to create a Schedule Policy/Career. I am not, and have never been a Federal employee; as a member of the public, however, I recognize the need for and value of the civil service. I am strongly encouraging OPM to ...</td>

The scientific process fundamentally depends on objectivity and independent expertise. By increasing the number of politically appointed employees in these positions, the federal granting agencies will therefore become more susceptible to political influence, potentially leading to the implementation of policies that are not based on sound scientific principles and rigorous scientific evidence. This could have devastating consequences for public health, national security, technological advancement, and global competitiveness. 

Therefore, I urge the administration to reconsider Schedule F and instead prioritize a merit-based civil service that values expertise and impartiality. A system where scientists and experts are protected from political pressure is essential to ensure that grant assessment is not a matter of partisan politics (irrespective of the party in power) to promote the advancement of scientific knowledge to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the American people.">I would like to express serious concerns regarding the proposed implementation of Schedule F because of its potential to undermine the scientific integrity of the federal granting process.

Millions upon millions of Americans depend upon the vital services that civil servants provide each and every day, and these services demand a corps of experienced, non-partisan professionals who have the skills, knowledge, and expertise to assist the public -- regardless of who sits in the White House.

As a group of U.S. legislators recently wrote, “Reclassifying civil service positions into the excepted service removes virtually all protections and rights currently afforded to civil servants. This includes due process and appeals rights that help ensure civil servants can conduct their duties without fear of politically motivated removal or retaliatory measures.”

Furthermore, the proposed rule -- as currently worded -- is excessively vague and leaves open the potential for massive numbers of civil servants to lose their protections, far more than the 50,000 jobs that OPM estimates.

Civil servants are essential to:
the schools where our kids learn and grow…
the parks where we enjoy sports and nature…
the safe and healthy foods we eat…
the medicines and care we receive to stay healthy..
the roads/railways/air routes we traverse to get to work and to explore this vast, beautiful country.

While I appreciate the intent of this rule. I think it is important that grants be reviewed and funded based on the quality and potential of the science they propose.  Science inherently is non-partisan and non-political and therefore, grant-making should also be non-partisan and non-political.   I fear that political interference in the grant assessment may negatively impact the scientific integrity of research. The main goal of research is to increase scientific knowledge so that we can understand diseases and impact health. Scientists are dedicated to their field of study. They thrive on the ability to solve complex medical problems for the benefit of the public. They sit with families who have small children with life-threatening diseases and desperately want to figure out a way to help these families. They do not care about the political affiliation of the person in front of them. What motivates us is to figure out how to help the children and their families.  American science is already severely affected by short-term appropriations, e.g., annual appropriations for the NIH, making it harder to fund long-term projects and therefore, limiting scientific advances. These advances take time to occur, often over many years and across multiple administrations.  Civil service protection has been in place for generations of workers who are devoted to serving their country and are non-partisan.  I think it could be challenging to recrui...

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee&#039;s belief that the employee has failed to &quot;faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,&quot; as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

3. I oppose the amendment of 5 CFR part 752 that removes the right of career civil servants to appeal the transfer of their position into an Excepted Service category, including the proposed Schedule Policy/Career category.

It&#039;s clear to me that with the political pendulum swinging back and forth between the parties, an increase in &quot;politicals&quot; will result in much more fragmented service to citizens, less consistency over time and fluctuating implementation of laws, rules and regulations.
The American public is best served by productive, professional, long-term public servants who take seriously their oath to the Constitution and to implementing and enforcing the laws, rules and regulations enacted by our elected officials.  Agency leaders have plenty of authority to influence the work of agency staff at the direction of the president; I know this from direct experience.  But professional agency staff also ensure those leaders stay aware of the bounds and guardrails enacted by Congress and provide historical perspective to those shorter-term political appointees.
Federal Service tenure should be managed by consistent, fair and even-handed performance reviews, as mandated by the Merit Systems Protection Board Personnel Practices.  American citizens deserve no less.

Studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share less-than-desirable information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.

Competent and responsible government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens. Firing 50,000 federal employees will tragically wound the trust that Americans have in their federal government. The vast majority of these employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day, that took what could arguably be considered a low paying job because they love their country.

This rules change seems like an attempt to severely hurt the American government and it&#039;s people.

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly 100 million Americans and cost the U.S. economy billions annually. The progress vision researchers have made—from gene therapies that restore sight to AI-driven diagnostics that detect systemic disease through the eye—has only been possible because of the long-term stability, independence, and credibility of federal science agencies, career staff, and the peer-review grant-making process.
Introducing political instability through Schedule F would:

I write to express my deep concern about reclassifying specific federal positions. This rule would erode necessary protections for staff in the federal statistical system, transforming positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for needed evidence. Federal statistics play an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans and inform critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. 

Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule for the following reasons:

1) Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could lead to the politicize of the federal statistical workforce. Federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. Thus, a President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career. Then, for example, BLS leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the President’s policy agenda. They might also face pressure to change methodologies or reveal pre-release information.

Civil servants deserve to have job security.  Taking this away would lower morale and cause an even greater exodus from this vital work force, causing inefficiency, confusion, and understaffing.

I believe this proposal is primarily about politicizing the civil service.  I do not believe it is about making it easier to get rid of &quot;bad&quot; employees, at least not if &quot;bad&quot; is viewed as a measure of job performance rather than political convictions.  Saying otherwise is a lie.  Repeating that lie more loudly while smirking is not a convincing argument to the contrary.">It is vital to the smooth running of our government agencies that civil service jobs NOT be polititicized.

Federal agencies depend on experienced scientific experts and data analysts with deep knowledge of complex systems. Under Schedule F, these experts could be removed en masse, resulting in (further) significant brain drain and the loss of institutional memory and technical expertise. Without civil service protections, scientists may feel pressured to self-censor or alter their findings to match political expectations. This would seriously damage the credibility and undermine integrity of government science. Accurate scientific input is essential in emergencies like pandemics, natural disasters, and chemical exposures.

This rule would return the United States to the political spoils system that was in place over 140 years ago. Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants. Federal workers would be hired based on political connections and ideology, rather than merit. 

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who lack the experience or qualifications to do their essential jobs. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

All Americans would suffer the consequences of having unqualified political hires serving in essential roles such as managing our precious public lands. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reject this rule and protect the integrity of the merit-based civil service system.

I worked for the government, primarily in the National Park Service, for more than 39 years. During that time, I worked under both republican and democratic administrations. Regardless of who was in charge, I received very high marks in the performance of my job. That is what government employees do – their jobs – regardless of changing political administrations.

The stability of the U.S. government is reliant upon the unbiased implementation of duties by its career employees. Altering the civil service protections of federal employees will create massive instability in carrying out the duties of federal agencies, especially in those that have bipartisan support, like the National Park Service, where commitment to the mission is routinely the highest of any agency. (No longer would that apply if this rule takes effect.)  This proposed change will expose public services provided by every federal agency to extreme political instability. 

As is currently happening, federal employees will feel and literally be threatened with job instability upon every administration change. That is no way to run a government. That is why civil service laws were created to provide stability and continuity, no matter which party is in power.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

This rule would allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands. That’s not accountability—it’s a recipe for instability, inefficiency, and the erosion of public trust.

Our nation’s public lands must be managed by nonpartisan professionals who are free to follow science, serve the public, and uphold conservation laws.

Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service
Posted by the Office of Personnel Management on Apr 22, 2025

The proposed rule change to establish Schedule Policy/Career raises several legal and ethical concerns. These concerns were often discussed in the context of prior rulemakings, particularly regarding the predecessor Schedule F, and the current proposed rule addresses and responds to them from the Office of Personnel Management&#039;s (OPM) updated perspective.
Here are some of the key legal and ethical concerns that require consideration before the enactment of the rule change
Legal Concerns:
Statutory Authority: A significant legal concern revolved around OPM&#039;s statutory authority, particularly under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), to extend chapter 75 adverse action procedures and appeals to employees whose positions are reclassified or transferred into policy-influencing excepted service schedules.  OPM&#039;s current proposed rule is partly based on the conclusion that its prior amendments in the April 2024 final rule, which purported to provide such protection for involuntarily moved incumbents, exceeded its statutory authority.  
Constitutionality: Commenters in prior rulemakings argued that Schedule F was unlawful, and OPM&#039;s prior views suggested legal error. 

Due Process: Concerns were raised regarding whether removing adverse action procedures for employees moved into policy-influencing positions would violate their con... [truncated]">Proposed Rule

America is far from perfect, but for the most part, we&#039;ve been stable, prosperous, and constantly on the forefront of innovation for the past 250 years. There is no other modern day country that can make that same claim. At least part of that can be attributed to the work of generations of federal employees that were hired on merit for the last 150 years, thanks to the overwhelmingly bipartisan Pendleton Act. Especially in this time of heightened political polarization, we need to appreciate the fact that federal hiring remains nonpartisan. I and my coworkers can do our jobs confidently and trust each other, knowing that we were all hired based on merit, and we work towards the same objective of serving this great country.

The administration that introduced this policy was notably embroiled in numerous lawsuits challenging the legality and constitutionality of its broader agenda, reinforcing the argument that the Schedule policy/career is part of a wider pattern of executive overreach and legal recklessness.

1. Legal Precedent of Overreach and Unlawful Policy

The administration that introduced the Schedule policy/career faced a historic number of lawsuits, many of which it lost in court. These legal defeats often centered around unlawful attempts to bypass statutory processes or undermine independent institutions — precisely the concern with the Schedule policy/career. Courts overturned numerous executive orders and regulatory actions for violating established laws and constitutional principles. This reclassification initiative fits the same mold: sweeping, unchecked, and vulnerable to judicial rejection.

2. Threat to Civil Service Protections

The Schedule policy/career would strip civil servants of long-standing due process rights, making them vulnerable to politically motivated removals. The administration’s track record of ignoring institutional norms and triggering legal action shows that such a policy would likely be...

What helps one party now, could be the very same thing that is used against it in the future. No one wants an incompetent workforce. Political values have nothing to do with performance. If this is really about accountability and reform, then why are we talking about political alliances instead?

• Massive Expansion of At-Will Employment: The proposed rule would dramatically expand the number of civil servants who serve at the pleasure of the President from approximately 4,000 political appointees to potentially hundreds of thousands of what had been career employees.
• Ideologically Driven Rulemaking: OPM makes sweeping claims about political “resistance” in the civil service based on cherry-picked anecdotes and selective surveys, using these to justify maximalist removal authority.
