We’ve seen firsthand that when clinical data is exchanged efficiently, transparently, and in ways that respect provider workflows and payer goals, the result is better care, reduced administrative burden, and stronger financial outcomes. Yet today’s ecosystem remains fragmented. Not just in its infrastructure, but in its incentives. Even the most advanced solutions cannot succeed and thrive if the underlying incentives don’t demand, or even support, sustainable alignment.

To truly modernize healthcare, CMS must go beyond policy directives and technical standards and instead foster conditions that reward the exchange and use of high quality clinical data. That means shifting the focus from technical eligibility to measurable impact. Impact on care, collaboration, and cost. 

While not experts in all aspects of health tech, our perspective is grounded in experience. By securely connecting with more than 100 health systems, the largest national and regional US health plans, and third-party requestors across the country, Moxe’s technology-first approach is fundamentally changing the way clinical data is shared for Payment and Operations use cases.

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this request for information. I am a board certified pathologist, and I spent the last ten years of my career before retirement as a medical officer in the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Prior to my work at ASPE I was at CMS where I worked on the Doctors Office Quality Information Technology Project and its continuation through the Quality Improvement Organization’s 8th scope of work. Based on this experience, our health technology ecosystem is limited in its performance for the following reasons.

First, it does not consider the tremendous complexity of diagnosing and treating the numerous disease combinations found in Medicare patients. While at ASPE I had access to a comprehensive database of Medicare claims data as well as extensive access to analytical tools and statisticians. The central finding of this research is that patients are surprisingly unique in their medical histories even at the national level. For example, the most complex 35% of Medicare patients account for approximately 80% of Medicare expenditures, and the national cell size of patients with similar disease combinations in this group is approximately 5 individuals. Each of these distinct combinations is small and scattered across the nation. One way to view this statistical fact is that patients with one of the many combinations of multiple diagnosis would fall into ... [truncated]">File Code: CMS-0042-NC

IntroductIon
We are witnessing a golden age in health care as new diagnostic 
modalities coupled with artificial intelligence and machine 
learning (AI/ML) improve our understanding of disease and 
our ability to care for patients. This era is unique in that we 
are experiencing innovation in three synergistic areas: new 
data types, new data sources, and novel actionable information 
through data manipulation. First, an explosion in diagnostic 
data provides fundamentally new types of information. These 
data include not only the familiar “omics” and imaging data 
categories (although greatly extended), but they also include 
entirely new data types that are often generated in the patient’s 
environment through cell phone and wearable technologies.[1,2] 
These new data types may be amon... [truncated]">ISSN : 2229-5089

I would like seniors to have the ability to know when their identity is used to file a claim.  The recent catheter scam, where beneficiaries were hit with copayment bills for goods and services never ordered by their physician and not needed, demonstrates the vulnerability that Medicare beneficiaries have.  The reporting process for potential fraud is cumbersome and requires significant manual intervention.

Subject: Public Comment on Digital Infrastructure Needs to Support Value-Based Care

To the CMS and ONC teams,

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Request for Information on modernizing the Medicare health technology ecosystem. As a company working closely with independent provider organizations—particularly Community Health Centers (CHCs), provider-led ACOs, and regional CINs—we deeply support CMS’s vision of improving care coordination, transparency, and equity through digital infrastructure.

We write today to respond specifically to the section of the RFI focused on Value-Based Care (VBC) and the role that digital infrastructure plays in advancing its success.

Key Recommendations for VBC Enablement

1. Create enforceable data standards that ensure real-time, two-way data exchange between payers and providers.
Providers in VBC arrangements often lack timely access to the very data they are measured on—claims, attribution, quality results, and benchmark performance. One CHC partner of ours, participating in both Medicaid MCO and MSSP programs, experienced a 90-day delay in receiving performance data, only to learn they had missed an incentive opportunity due to outdated rosters and unaccounted exclusions. These gaps aren’t just f... [truncated]">Submission to CMS/ONC Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem

TD-4: How can CMS better encourage use of open, standards -based, publicly available 
APIs over proprietary APIs?  
Over the past decade, CMS has implemented programs and rules to promote the adoption of 
health information technology (IT), particularly through its leadership in driving electronic health record (EHR) adoption and interoperability. Initiatives such as the  Promoting 
Interoperability Programs (formerly known as Meaningful Use), as well as regulatory efforts like the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, have been pivotal. The 21st Century 
Cures Act Final Rule (enforced by ATSP and supported by CMS) built on the foundation of 
these programs and rules by requiring developers and payers to support standards -based APIs 
using HL7® FHIR®. These efforts marked a major policy shift toward patient access, data 
liquidity, and innovation through APIs.  
Building on the Cures Act,  CMS can help accelerate the maturation of data standards , not only 
through regulation, but also by supporting collaborative, public -private ef... [truncated]">©2025 Lantana Consulting Group. All rights reserved / www.lantanagroup.com

The ontology provides a harmonized representation of laboratory and clinical observations by embedding LOINC concepts within the SNOMED CT ontological structure. This alignment allows for consistent semantic interpretation across systems, supporting more robust FHIR-based data exchange, clinical quality measurement, and public health reporting.
The ontology now in its v1.0 release as of March 2025 contains over 35,000 mapped concepts covering high-volume laboratory tests and physiological measurements (LOINC / SNOMED CT – Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and SNOMED International, n.d.). It offers implementers the flexibility to use LOINC, SNOMED CT, or the harmonized concepts based on their system’s needs, reducing duplication and ensuring semantic alignment. CMS should consider referencing this ontology in certification criteria, USCDI+, and quality programs to accelerate alignment with international terminology best practices and promote more meaningful use of structured data in real-world workflows.

The LOINC SNOMED CT extension (LOINC SNOMED ontology) will be very helpful for stakeholders. The LOINC model is different than the SNOMED CT concept model for various reasons and it’s wonderful to see the LOINC will be “SNOMED-ized” with the attributes, etc.

So I&#039;m not sure what technology Medicare plans to put forward with the rest of the world, please be sure you take those into account who are elder and don&#039;t know technology or have access to a computer.  I have formed a committee that includes members of CMS for a Medicare Beneficiary advocacy team, but they are currently on pause at CMS, so this is temporarily on-hold.  Please be aware, there are cases where Medicare Beneficiaries are being denied treatment by medical providers due to OPEN medicals on a WC claim.  I&#039;ve had several cases where they were denied hospice care and the most recent situation a Medicare Beneficiary was REMOVED from an Organ donation wait list due to an open WC claim.  Please visit me on Linkedin you will see stories about this.  While I appreciate reaching out for feedback on this program as it&#039;s very important, CMS with the Workers&#039; Comp industry need to make the issues with the Medicare Beneficiaries a top priority.

With CMS significantly strengthening RADV audits through annual reviews, increased record sampling, and extrapolation of findings to entire contracts, the need for robust documentation integrity at scale is paramount. Tennr proposes to provide its Qualifications product and ICD-10 code extraction model directly to the CMS RADV audit team. This technology can enable CMS to proactively identify and validate diagnoses at scale, efficiently review audits by automating medical record validation, enhance financial integrity by ensuring accurate documentation for billed diagnoses, and complement CMS&#039;s own enhanced technology and growing medical coder team.

Dear Sir or Madam,
We are the members of the informal Trebuchet subgroup on Clinical Documentation Supporting 
Orders (CDSO).   We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the CMS and ONC/ASTP RFI on 
Health Technology ecosystem, file code CMS-0042-NC.
The CDSO Trebuchet subgroup is comprised of:
•Parachute Health, 
•Mesh Health Solutions,  
•Combs-Dyer Consulting, 
•Drummond Group, 
•Farseen Advisors, 
•Onyx Technology, 
•Tomorrow Health and 
•others.  
We wish to comment on the state of data interoperability and the broader health technology 
infrastructure as it relates to payers’ dual role of:
1)preventing improper payments, including fraud and abuse, and 
2) reducing providers’ administrative burden
Our comments include a list recommended actions for CMS and ONC/ASTP to consider taking 
that could help payers meet – and carefully balance -- these two goals.

Marani Health, a digital health innovator focused on maternal and fetal care, appreciates the opportunity to provide input on CMS and ASTP/ONC’s Request for Information regarding digital health tools and health technology infrastructure.

We strongly support the Administration’s vision for a patient-centered, interoperable health technology ecosystem. We urge CMS and ONC to explicitly prioritize maternal health in its digital health strategy, and offer the following recommendations based on our work deploying prenatal monitoring technologies that serve Medicaid populations:
________________________________________
1. Enable Broader Data Access for Maternal Monitoring (PC-2, PC-9)
Our patients and providers face data fragmentation, often unable to unify pregnancy-specific clinical data (e.g., fetal heart rate, fundal height, weight gain trends) across systems. Integration of maternal and fetal data from devices and EMRs into APIs like Blue Button 2.0 would enable more holistic and timely care—especially valuable for managing high-risk pregnancies.
Recommendation: Expand API-supported data types to include pregnancy-related vitals, structured OB notes, and fetal monitoring outputs. Enable seamless third-party access through patient consent.

2. Prioritize Remote Monitoring in Covered Digital Health (PC-1, VB-3)
Non-invasive remote monitoring enables early detection of conditions like pre... [truncated]">Comment on CMS-0042-NC, Submitted by Marani Health

Introduction: Dimer’s Transitionist Medicine as a Model for CMS Innovation
Dimer Health is pleased to offer its response to the CMS Request for Information: 
Health Technology Ecosystem.  Below, we provide responses to sections B, C, E &amp; F of 
the RFI.   Briefly, Dimer Health takes the position that the healthcare technology 
ecosystem must move beyond incremental optimization toward fully operational, 
patient-centered care transformation. We urge CMS not merely to encourage innovation 
in the abstract, but to reserve space within its digital strategy for entirely new models of 
care delivery. A critical example is Dimer’s Transitionist model—a technology-enabled 
service line that bridges acute care, post-acute coordination, and population... [truncated]">Dimer Health Response to RFI the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

When it comes to health technology my primary concern is privacy rights for patients as well as parental rights. My requests are pretty straightforward

1. There should be absolutely no digital ID requirement for any human being to access healthcare in America, ever.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever.

3. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if AI or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted.

4. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard.

Thank you for your time and consideration.">I am a health freedom activist from New York who opposes all medical mandates to access society.

Dear  Assistant  Secretary:  
We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the Request for Information (RFI) on the Health Technology Ecosystem and to share our feedback as one of the nation’s first and longest operating 
health information exchange (HIE) organizations .   
 
The Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) is a nonprofit corporation serving the state of 
Indiana to facilitate and support secure, interoperable data exchange.  IHIE was founded in 2004 
and has become one of the largest HIEs in the U.S.  IHIE connect s over 38 health systems, 19,000 
practices, and 54,500 providers with public health agencies, providers, and health plans with data 
covering more than 20 million patients.    
 
Below, we offer our response on certain areas of focus involving the role of HIEs, interoperability, 
and TEFCA.  
 
On behalf of IHIE and other HIEs, we appreciate your consideration of our responses and welcome the o... [truncated]">846 N. Senate Avenue, Suite 110   │   Indianapolis, IN  46202    │     Ph: 317.644.1750    │    F: 317.222- 3800   │ www.ihie.org

What specific opportunities and challenges exist to improve accessibility, interoperability and integration of clinical data from different sources to enable more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence?

A key challenge in enabling more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence is the lack of shared agreement in how to communicate clinical research and evidence data throughout all phases of research design, conduct, analysis, and reporting.

Key opportunities are established with the Evidence Based Medicine on FHIR (EBMonFHIR) Implementation Guide and the Scientific Evidence Code System (SEVCO). 

The HL7 FHIR standard (Health Level 7 International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is already accepted and encouraged throughout the CMS/ASTP/ONC efforts noted in this HHS RFI as the standard for health data exchange.  Prior to 2018 there was no equivalent standard to support data exchange for scientific evidence.

In 2018, participants from communities of biomedical/healthcare research, systematic review development, clinical practice guideline development, and clinical decision support development collaborated to obtain approval of HL7 to extend FHIR to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge assets, a project now called EBMonFHIR.

The community supporting the EBMonFHIR project evolved to become the Health Evidence...

This response to the HHS RFI CMS-0042-NC regarding Health Technology Ecosystem  
is specific to a health management application (defined in this RFI as a digital tool to 
support patients with health-decision making).
Problem(s) overcome by this health management app:
Deciding whether to use a clinical intervention often requires weighing the expected 
benefits against the expected harms. Quantifying the expected benefits and harms 
requires finding and interpreting the evidence specific to the clinical intervention and the 
patient’s characteristics. Individualizing the determination of balance of effects requires 
knowing the patient’s relative importance of each benefit and harm. Despite 
instantaneous decision support for complex decision making in other environments 
(such as traffic navigation), there is no such common solution for healthcare decisions.
Data inputs for this health management app:

patient health data
