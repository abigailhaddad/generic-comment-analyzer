PR-1a:
Current obstacles include lack of reimbursement pathways, limited integration with existing EHR systems, inconsistent interoperability standards across varied data formats, and provider burden related to documentation and workflow disruptions. Rural providers also face infrastructure and staffing limitations.

PR-2:
Development and deployment obstacles include fragmented data standards, lack of standardized APIs supporting full data spectrum (structured and unstructured), and administrative burdens. These could be mitigated by CMS promoting open, standards-based APIs like FHIR, and supporting bulk data access for efficient quality measurement reporting.

PR-3:
Full accessibility of all EHR data formats (including scanned documents, free-text notes, and sensor data) is crucial for comprehensive care. Technical barriers and privacy concerns must be addressed via policy incentives and infrastructure support.

Comment Category: Health Information Technology

I am Dr. Niraj Patel, DO MBA, CEO &amp; co-founder of Wavital, a U.S. Class I MDDS platform that streams 300 Hz physiologic waveforms and continuous vitals from multi-vendor bedside monitors into Bulk FHIR pipelines in real time. Each patient-day yields ~26 million data points that can avert ICU transfers, but today zero of them flow through CMS-mandated APIs. I appreciate the chance to comment on the Health Technology Ecosystem RFI.

CMS and ONC should unlock bedside data, stop warranty-based information blocking, and create a voluntary AI-safety label. These actions will reduce nurse workload, lower VBP/HRRP penalties, and catalyze safer AI at the bedside, especially for rural hospitals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. USCDI-Vitals = Add continuous waveforms &amp; ≥1 Hz vitals to USCDI and TEFCA by CY 2027, using IEEE 11073 terminology &amp; HL7 v2 MDM. [TD-7, PC-10]  
2. IEEE 11073 SDC transport = Require basic SDC “plug-and-trust” discovery/time-sync in the 2028 CEHRT update to eliminate vendor-proprietary serial links. [TD-4, PR-5]  
3. Bulk FHIR sandbox = Fund a pilot that posts de-identified streaming vitals + claims (“Physiology-at-Scale”) for AI/ML R&amp;D. [TD-15, VB-3]  
4. Clinical AI Safety Label = Add a voluntary ONC certification track with provenance metadata, model-version logging, and drift reporting. [TD-8, TD-10]  
5. Alert endpoints = Tie the 2024 Provider-Access API rule to alert channels so Shock-Index&gt;1 can ... [truncated]">Docket ID: CMS-0042-NC

One &amp; Done Smart Bids is a patent-pending platform optimizing Medicare Advantage (MA) plan selection, saving $104 billion annually for 35.7 million enrollees ($2,922 average per MA plan annually; $3,846 per MA-PD plan annually). We thank CMS and ASTP/ONC for this RFI and offer insights to advance a patient-centric digital health ecosystem, aligning with CMMI’s value-based care (VBC) goals.

PC-1, PC-4: Health Management Apps
One &amp; Done Smart Bids empowers seniors with one-click plan optimization, analyzing claims and health data to recommend plans saving $3,846 annually for MA-PD enrollees ($2,922 overall MA average). Its patent-pending technology enables real-time cost comparisons and care navigation integration, features absent in current apps. CMS could enable these via standardized MA data APIs.

PC-5, TD-1: Encouraging Adoption
We propose a no-cost CMMI pilot to test One &amp; Done Smart Bids, building on 117,100 scenarios showing $3,846 annual savings for MA-PD enrollees. CMS could certify apps for efficacy (e.g., consumer savings, user satisfaction) and promote them via Medicare.gov.

Dear CMS Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the Health Technology Ecosystem. I appreciate CMS&#039;s efforts to enhance digital health solutions for Medicare beneficiaries.

1. Addressing the Digital Divide Among Seniors
While digital health technologies offer significant benefits, it&#039;s crucial to recognize that many seniors face challenges in adopting these tools. Factors such as limited digital literacy, cognitive impairments, and physical disabilities can hinder their ability to effectively use health technologies. To ensure equitable access, CMS should consider:
- Implementing user-friendly interfaces tailored for seniors
- Providing training programs to enhance digital literacy
- Ensuring availability of alternative support channels, such as telephonic assistance
Additionally, I recommend establishing a test group that includes both seniors and younger individuals, alongside medical staff, to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of health technology applications. This diverse testing group can provide valuable feedback on real-world functionality, accessibility, and clarity. Ensuring input from people who actually use and support these tools will improve design, reduce frustration, and increase adoption.
2. Shortage of Endocrinologists and Diabetes Nurse Educators
The increasing prevalence of diabetes among the aging population underscores the need for specialized care. However, there&#039;s a notable short... [truncated]">Response to CMS RFI: Health Technology Ecosystem

AI-assisted Clinical Documentation Integrity tools can streamline chart reviews, identify 
undocumented diagnoses, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis-related group assignment and 
risk adjustment, which are critical for value-based care models. According to a 2023 JAMA 
study, AI enhanced CDI programs led to a 22 percent increase in appropriate severity capture 
and a 14 percent reduction in documentation omissions. However, AI systems must be used with 
caution, as they can misinterpret clinical nuance, generate compliance risk queries, or contribute 
to provider burnout through excessive alerts. Additionally, reliance on AI without human clinical 
oversight may undermine professional judgment and introduce unintended bias. CMS should 
encourage innovation in AI while ensuring transparency, clinical oversight, and strict adherence 
to established CDI and query guidelines to make sure AI supports rather than compromises 
patient centered, ethical, and data informed care.

The U.S. government funded training for substance abuse researchers in entrepreneurship at Yale, so they could learn how to get more funding for their health care startups about substance abuse.

Scholarly articles have been published about &quot;The Psychology of Entrepreneurship&quot;. One such study we noticed focused on industrial and organizational psychology (it has its own abbreviation, I/O); many of its key conclusions were to plead for more research in that area. We think that one of the primary goals of this kind of psychobabble is to set the stage for getting more research funds, rather than coming up with anything truly useful.

Another news article in the Washington Post &quot;noticed that entrepreneurs seem inclined to have mental health issues.&quot; There are any number of news reports about &quot;the problems entrepreneurs with mental illness often face,&quot; and &quot;managing your mental health as an entrepreneur,&quot; and yet again &quot;the psychological price of entrepreneurship.&quot;

Comment Summary
As a skilled nursing administrator overseeing a high-acuity, Medicaid-funded facility, I urge CMS to recognize the disconnect between value-based care design and the operational realities in post-acute settings. Our teams are essential to reducing readmissions, managing transitions, and improving outcomes, yet we are often excluded from strategic planning and under-resourced to meet performance expectations.
1. Structural Barriers to Innovation in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)
Current federal regulations were built for episodic, fee-for-service care. SNFs operate in a relationship-driven, highly variable environment where top-down mandates do not translate into consistent frontline execution.
Barriers include:
- Medicaid reimbursement that limits investment in tech infrastructure
- Staff shortages and wage constraints that reduce bandwidth for innovation
- Lack of interoperability with hospital systems and care partners
- Manual, burdensome reporting requirements that take time away from care

I have formed a committee that includes members of CMS for a Medicare Beneficiary advocacy team, but they are currently on pause at CMS, so this is temporarily on-hold.  Please be aware, there are cases where Medicare Beneficiaries are being denied treatment by medical providers due to OPEN medicals on a WC claim.  I&#039;ve had several cases where they were denied hospice care and the most recent situation a Medicare Beneficiary was REMOVED from an Organ donation wait list due to an open WC claim.  Please visit me on Linkedin you will see stories about this.  While I appreciate reaching out for feedback on this program as it&#039;s very important, CMS with the Workers&#039; Comp industry need to make the issues with the Medicare Beneficiaries a top priority.

I never set out to fix healthcare—I just wanted to survive it. But like too many patients, I was misdiagnosed, delayed, and dismissed—because the system was too fragmented to see the full picture. What should have been a simple pharmacogenomic test became a years-long journey through silos, policy gaps, and out-of-pocket costs. That experience nearly broke me—but it also gave me purpose.

My submission calls for the creation of a National Safe Harbor for Real-World Interoperability Testing—not as another pilot, but as permanent infrastructure to validate the connections that patients, providers, and pharmacists actually depend on: PGx, ePA, RTBC, DTx, and pharmacy-centered workflows. I believe we need to stop asking patients to stitch their care together—and start building a system that’s unified by design.

I’ve included supporting materials, including a pharmacy interoperability white paper, a precision medicine executive summary I coauthored, and personal commentaries on data access, trust, and patient equity. These aren’t theoretical papers—they reflect lived challenges and the real cost of inaction.

My goal isn’t to critique what’s been done—it’s to urge us to do better. To center patients, include pharmacy, and align health tech with outcomes, not optics.

Through interviews with key stakeholders, including representatives from specialty pharmacies, traditional 
community pharmacies, chain pharmacies, technology vendors, and Health Information Exchanges (HIE) and 
Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs in TEFCA), several key themes emerged regarding the current 
state of interoperability.
Technology Availability vs. Adoption
While many vendors have developed capabilities for clinical data sharing, actual adoption by pharmacies 
remains low. Interviewees consistently cited the lack of reimbursement models and business incentives as 
significant barriers to broader adoption of these technologies.

I do feel that that proposed idea regarding prevention of disease has always been a good idea. Truth is dispensing accurate and full information regarding disease prevention and essential tools for maintaining good health would be foremost what is needed since there is conflicting information coming from healthcare industry vs natural healing methods. Food, and definitely a new food pyramid, and educating regarding things Seniors can do to extend their lives using and exploring food and natural herbs as preventative medicine and encouraging programs for exercise is a good idea. Getting the processed food, chemicals, and especially the glyphosates and corn syrup out of the food supply is a good start, so is limiting salt and sugar in foods being sold. Also, Telehealth is the future of Healthcare and very necessary to Disabled, Elderly and those that live in Rural Areas without Transportation. Speaking of which, can we please see that health plans support those who need it with Transportation to their medical appointments, as is being done for Medicaid?

Introduction
I am a parent of a child with autism and I&#039;ve had to navigate many broken systems--healthcare, education,
and housing--that fail to fully support families like mine. I want to share a few critical ways the health
technology ecosystem could be improved to make a real difference in people&#039;s lives.
1. Digital Access Gaps in Underserved Communities
Digital health technology must work for everyone -- especially people in low-income communities who may
not have high-speed internet, smartphones, or advanced tech knowledge. HHS should invest in tools that
work offline, through SMS, or in simple mobile formats. Digital literacy training should be made available for
families, seniors, and caregivers.
2. Support for Medicaid &amp; Medically Needy Populations
Many families, including mine, depend on Medically Needy Medicaid. Health technology systems must reflect
the complexity of these cases and not assume everyone has full coverage. The systems should clearly alert
patients if services or prescriptions aren&#039;t covered and should offer affordable or free alternatives where
possible.

1. Integrate data across settings and networks via TEFCA and FHIR APIs.  
Apps should offer a unified view of a patient’s journey across primary care, specialty 
care, behavioral health, and social determinants — using QHINs and local HIEs to pull in 
FHIR -based records.

Use SNOMED CT -coded care plans and problem lists, LOINC -coded lab results, and

Brief info about the iPill : 

iPill addresses the lack of medication adherence as an FDA Class II breakthrough designated product.

iPill deck https://docsend.com/view/7t5vhu37ic4tw2se

Problem
The end-user dispensing pharmacy and end-user prescribing physician have endless regulations to follow when prescribing opioids, but the final user patient has no rules or regulations at home and can easily misuse, divert, actually overdose on the opioid they are prescribed. 

That is the reason 75% of patients don’t take their prescribed medications correctly which results in 125,000 deaths annually and $290 billion per year in additional healthcare expenditures because of higher rates of hospital admissions, suboptimal health outcomes, and higher morbidity/mortality for chronic conditions.

CareAtlas helps keep patients “Healthy and Happy at Home” by partnering with providers to deliver Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM). We use home devices for real-time tracking, provide regular check-ins, medication reminders, diet and lifestyle coaching, and coordinate care to reduce hospitalizations and support independent living. Our team-based approach ensures patients, doctors, and caregivers stay connected between visits⁠

Despite clear benefits, current digital health infrastructure and reimbursement are not sufficient to support robust, evidence-based services in nutrition, sleep, and mental health. While CareAtlas offers basic diet and lifestyle support, policy and technology barriers limit our ability to deliver comprehensive nutrition interventions. The same is true for sleep and behavioral health—critical domains for chronic disease prevention and management that are not yet fully integrated into Medicare digital health workflows⁠

I commend CMS for its forward-thinking approach to modernizing digital health infrastructure and promoting equitable access to innovation. I would like to offer comments on two critical areas: Innovation and Reimbursement, and Digital Divide and Health Equity.
1. Innovation and Reimbursement
While the digital health sector is rapidly evolving, reimbursement models have not kept pace with the innovation landscape. Many promising technologies—such as remote monitoring tools, AI-driven diagnostics, and digital therapeutics—face significant barriers to adoption due to unclear or inconsistent reimbursement pathways.
Recommendations:
	• Establish clear, scalable reimbursement frameworks for digital health tools that demonstrate clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
	• Expand coverage with evidence development (CED) models to support emerging technologies while data is being collected.
	• Encourage value-based payment models that reward outcomes achieved through digital interventions, not just traditional in-person care.
Without these changes, innovators may be discouraged from developing tools for Medicare populations, and providers may hesitate to adopt them due to financial uncertainty.
2. Digital Divide and Health Equity
The promise of digital health will remain unfulfilled if it does not reach the populations who need it most. Many Medicare beneficiaries—particularly those in rural areas,...

You’ve asked the right question.

How can CMS evolve policy to meet the realities of modern healthcare delivery, particularly where digital infrastructure is no longer auxiliary, but foundational?

Out of the multitude we should consider, here’s one clear opportunity:

Reimburse Distributed Clinical Logic.

Across the system today, we’re seeing software (not people) making real-time decisions that directly impact care:

• Routing a patient from surgery to physical therapy
• Escalating behavioral risk based on pattern decompensation
• Titrating medication timing based on dynamic context
• Detecting social need and auto-triggering intervention

These aren’t administrative workflows.
They’re clinical decisions, executed with speed, consistency, and scalability no human can match.

Unfortunately, none of this is billable.

Not under FFS. Not under most APMs. Not under most value-based tech carveouts.

As a result, systems that think, that coordinate, escalate, and guide care with clinical-grade intelligence are treated as cost centers. 

And not because they lack value, but because the reimbursement system doesn’t yet recognize intelligence as infrastructure.

I’m proposing that it should.

What is Distributed Clinical Logic (DCL)?

It’s a framework for understanding how real-time, rule-based or AI-enabled decision engines guide care delivery across the system.

The peoples health identifiable information should and must stay private. Under no circumstance should it be shared with any party without the consent of the individual this information need to be able to be audited by the individual as well. For example if a patient uses their visa atm card to pay a co-pay under no circumstance should the Dr. office be sharing anything with visa or experian/tranunion etc or anyone. Another example: If records for a specialty doctor are needed only the specialist should be provided the info and ONLY after the patient has authorized the disclosure.

I am a caregiver for my 87 year old mother, who moved from her home to assisted living in November 2024. I am also the Director of Health Information for a residential special hospital in NJ. It has been quite a task to gather and share my mother&#039;s medical records, as not all providers use Epic in their practices. For those who do, I have set up sharing to enhance the exchange of information. My mother, having dementia, cannot navigate the use of MyChart, and has never used it even before she was diagnosed.

I see a tremendous gap in communication with the assited living facility, which does not seem to have an EMR that is able to be shared with families/caregivers. There is also a gap in practice because I, as someone in the HIM field for 40+ years, note that the agency does have someone knowledgable about patient registration and the importance of sharing accurate information across the care continuum. For example, my mother&#039;s facesheet lists 3 primary care physicians, one of whom was apparently assigned by the rehab facility without conversation with her or me. i have asked more than once for a correction, to remove those who are not her primary from that facesheet.

Prescriptions for medications have gotten lost along the way between transfers from acute care to rehab to ALU. Even with my knowledge and experience, it&#039;s been difficult to get that straightened out, so I see the challenge for those with less knowledge and patience.

Specifically, I’m speaking to the Addison product from electronic caregiver. My general practitioner. In Alaska uses it. Up here because of the far-flung nature of the states population, it’s not only a great tool to provide cost savings, but it’s necessary to be able to track and diagnose issues in rural communities off of the road system.

As policymakers consider moving from annual to semi-annual redeterminations, we see an urgent need to replace outdated, paper-based processes with automated, AI-enhanced, digital-first solutions that leverage existing infrastructure and commercial innovations.

Policy Recommendations: Make Renewal Smarter, Not Just More Frequent
1. Fund automation and AI-driven renewal workflows

CMS should encourage and fund solutions that:
•	Auto-populate renewal forms with existing eligibility data (e.g., SNAP, 
        TANF, SSA);

To whom it may concern:

We at CNMIGA.ORG are submitting this comment in response to the Request for Information (RFI) CMS-0042-NC regarding digital health products, interoperability, and patient data access.

We urgently raise a matter of national and ethical concern in the U.S. territory of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), specifically regarding operations at the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC), located at 1178 Hinemlu Street, Garapan, Saipan, MP 96950.

Over 90% of CHCC’s medical staff are foreign nationals/non-American citizens. While we support workforce diversity and international expertise, we cannot ignore the alarming frequency of reported medical malpractice incidents and documented instances of identity theft. These incidents threaten not only patient safety but also national data integrity, especially given the sensitive health data managed under HIPAA protections.

In light of these systemic issues, CNMIGA.ORG urgently calls for the following mandatory safeguards to be adopted into CMS and ONC rulemaking and enforced at all medical facilities, especially those operating in U.S. territories:

I. General Observations

CMS and ONC have made progress in building a standards-based, interoperable health data ecosystem through initiatives like Blue Button 2.0, FHIR APIs, and TEFCA. However, challenges remain in achieving seamless, patient-centric access, reducing provider burden, and fostering digital health innovation.

A. Patients and Caregivers
PC-1 &amp; PC-2: Health Management and Access

Patients need integrated health apps to:

View all data (claims, notes, imaging, labs) in one place.

Schedule appointments, get reminders, access cost estimates.

Share data securely with caregivers and providers.

Fragmented portals force patients to manage multiple logins, impeding care coordination.

PC-4 &amp; PC-5: Missing Features and CMS Role

Key missing features include:

Universal data aggregation across payers/providers.

Real-time provider availability.

Personalized health guidance.

CMS could:

Promote open standards and certify digital health products for usability and accessibility.

Enhance beneficiary education on digital tools.

Support reimbursement for digital engagement.

PC-6: Accessibility

Digital health products should prioritize:

Simple interfaces.

Multilingual support and assistive tech.

One critical opportunity is to better support family caregivers- the invisible frontline of elder care. These are the people making decisions at 9 PM, in Spanish, after their loved one has been discharged, with no case manager in sight.

I urge CMS to recognize and fund technologies that:

Use AI and voice interfaces to guide caregivers in real time,

Explain plan benefits (like meals, rides, home care) clearly and in multiple languages, available after work hours and on weekends,

Track benefit usage to meet required CMS reporting and Star Rating needs,

Give caregivers tools to access benefits without turning them into providers.

If CMS is serious about meeting people where they are, then modern tools must be multilingual, accessible after hours, and built around trusted family relationships, not just patient portals.

Please ensure that future digital health policy supports non-clinical, trustworthy AI-powered tools that help caregivers navigate the system to support their aging loved ones.

Thank you for your commitment to building a smarter, more equitable future for Medicare.

As a chronic pain patient I have been adversely impacted by the current way data is shared between government agencies.

Yet prosecutors are getting convict by controlling that information process. Doctors who’ve not been the pill mills we were told about, those are long gone. This is prohibition through the back door. 

Database engineers are not law enforcement and shouldn’t be treated as the end all for the government. To me, this is laziness for government law who now work “list” generated by a database search and consider the data as 100% reliable not even taking enough time to adequately evaluate each individual on the list prior to initiating a legal action. 

Finally. At 63 and on Medicare I am incredibly frightened by the way medical has been impacted by data compliance issues. We are managed by computers and rely on the integrity of our care staff to ensure data accuracy. We need accountability for the integrity of the data used in decision analysis.

Brief info about the iPill : 

iPill addresses the lack of medication adherence as an FDA Class II breakthrough designated product.

Problem
The end-user dispensing pharmacy and end-user prescribing physician have endless regulations to follow when prescribing opioids, but the final user patient has no rules or regulations at home and can easily misuse, divert, actually overdose on the opioid they are prescribed. 

That is the reason 75% of patients don’t take their prescribed medications correctly which results in 125,000 deaths annually and $290 billion per year in additional healthcare expenditures because of higher rates of hospital admissions, suboptimal health outcomes, and higher morbidity/mortality for chronic conditions.
 
With opioids, opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose death can occur.  In 2023, there were 110,000 opioid overdose deaths at a cost of $2.7 trillion in medical expenses, unemp...

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this critical RFI. Kbrax is a health technology company committed to advancing equitable, whole-person care for Medicare beneficiaries and underserved populations through interoperable, intelligent tools. Our work is grounded in the pillars of access to care, quality of care, cost efficiency, and care innovation.
We built the CompleteCarePlatform to unify care coordination, behavioral health, and AI-driven insights into one scalable solution that empowers both patients and care teams. Including:
•             CareNavigator: a care coordination platform that enables advocates and navigators to track care journeys, close gaps, and respond to risk signals in real-time.
•             MindPure: a patient-facing mobile app that promotes mental health, self-awareness, and proactive engagement, especially for seniors and those facing stigma around behavioral health.
•             State-driven AI engine: an intelligent prioritization layer that personalizes outreach, assigns tasks, and integrates behavioral, medical, and social data to support timely intervention.
Our platform equips care advocates to shepherd Medicare members to appropriate, high-quality, cost-effective, and culturally relevant care, regardless of geography, digital literacy, or socioeconomic status.

This response highlights how Tennr&#039;s comprehensive system is crucial for improving patient outcomes, reducing care delays, and, critically, for assisting CMS in effectively managing and scaling its oversight responsibilities, particularly concerning the increasingly rigorous Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits.

With CMS significantly strengthening RADV audits through annual reviews, increased record sampling, and extrapolation of findings to entire contracts, the need for robust documentation integrity at scale is paramount. Tennr proposes to provide its Qualifications product and ICD-10 code extraction model directly to the CMS RADV audit team. This technology can enable CMS to proactively identify and validate diagnoses at scale, efficiently review audits by automating medical record validation, enhance financial integrity by ensuring accurate documentation for billed diagnoses, and complement CMS&#039;s own enhanced technology and growing medical coder team.

Medicare - real traditional Medicare - is better for patients. It is less costly, costs taxpayers less, and provides fair compensation policies for hard working doctors.

Stop waisting tax payer money by pretending and asking how to make a for profit system play by the rules of interoperability. Face it, for profit insurance treats our personal information as their’s. It’s a gold mine.">You can put standards in your place but as long as there is public and private insurance data sharing across the two isn’t going to happen, unless patients are given rights, in law that give them control and authority of  over how their data is used.

Unlike the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, Medicare is a Closed System—And That’s Hurting Beneficiaries

In the Marketplace, consumers can easily compare every available plan thanks to public APIs and federally maintained exchanges. Private innovators can build tools and experiences that improve transparency and ease of enrollment. Brokers are empowered to serve clients by showing all their options without artificial restrictions from insurers.

In stark contrast, the Medicare ecosystem is closed and highly restricted. Plan data is not accessible via APIs. Carriers selectively decide which brokers or e-brokers can represent their plans, granting or revoking access at their discretion—often based on commercial favoritism, not consumer interest.

This creates a perverse dynamic: brokers, who should serve as unbiased advisors, are functionally captive to the whims of carriers. I’ve personally experienced—and can verify—that a broker&#039;s ability to represent plans can be revoked arbitrarily, for reasons unrelated to compliance or ethics. It’s a shadowy gatekeeping structure that undermines the entire promise of informed choice in Medicare.

As a licensed Medicare agent who has spent years guiding retirees and near-retirees through their Medicare options, I strongly support modernizing the Medicare enrollment and plan comparison experience. Our current system is outdated, opaque, and burdensome—not just for brokers, but for the very individuals Medicare is supposed to protect.

Unlike the ACA Marketplace, Medicare lacks a centralized, transparent platform for plan comparison and enrollment. Brokers are forced to navigate restrictive and fragmented carrier relationships, where access to plan data and enrollment tools is tightly controlled and can be revoked without cause. This leaves consumers at a disadvantage and undermines the goal of offering unbiased, comprehensive support.

I respectfully urge CMS to consider the following:

Develop public APIs for Medicare plan data to allow third parties and developers to build robust, consumer-friendly tools.

Centralize and streamline broker certification and contracting under CMS rather than individual carriers.

Implement protections against arbitrary de-appointment of brokers who are licensed, certified, and compliant.

Allow technology-driven innovation in Medicare plan comparison tools, similar to the ACA model.

Revise marketing rules in a way that balances consumer protections with the freedom to provide educational, transparent outreach.

To the CMS and ONC teams,

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Request for Information on modernizing the Medicare health technology ecosystem. As a company working closely with independent provider organizations—particularly Community Health Centers (CHCs), provider-led ACOs, and regional CINs—we deeply support CMS’s vision of improving care coordination, transparency, and equity through digital infrastructure.

We write today to respond specifically to the section of the RFI focused on Value-Based Care (VBC) and the role that digital infrastructure plays in advancing its success.

Key Recommendations for VBC Enablement

1. Create enforceable data standards that ensure real-time, two-way data exchange between payers and providers.
Providers in VBC arrangements often lack timely access to the very data they are measured on—claims, attribution, quality results, and benchmark performance. One CHC partner of ours, participating in both Medicaid MCO and MSSP programs, experienced a 90-day delay in receiving performance data, only to learn they had missed an incentive opportunity due to outdated rosters and unaccounted exclusions. These gaps aren’t just f... [truncated]">Submission to CMS/ONC Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem

As a stakeholder engaged in health IT transformation for Community Health Centers, I appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments and recommendations aligned with the RFI’s key focus areas:

Patients &amp; Caregivers
CMS should collaborate with digital literacy initiatives to ensure digital tools are accessible to seniors, low-income populations, and marginalized communities. I recommend that CMS fund pilot programs to support the development of “navigation-first” digital health apps that prioritize ease of use for appointment scheduling, care team communication, and personal health goal tracking.

Providers
The administrative burden on providers related to quality reporting and interoperability compliance remains significant. CMS should consider allowing EHR vendors to transmit aggregated, risk-adjusted quality metrics directly to CMS using Bulk FHIR APIs, which would reduce manual reporting and improve workflow efficiency.

Payers
Many payers still lack standardized APIs for data exchange. CMS should align payer expectations with Blue Button and Data at Point of Care initiatives, and link payer participation in CMS programs to demonstrable progress in adopting digital identity standards and FHIR-based APIs.

Technology Vendors &amp; Networks
ONC certification pathways continue to be complex for developers, particularly those building innovative or non-traditional applications. I recommend the creation of a ... [truncated]">Advancing a Patient-Centered Digital Health Infrastructure

I’m the full-time, unpaid caregiver for my Kindergarten-aged son, a four-time brain cancer and stroke survivor. I’m also a healthcare professional with 15 years of experience and deep expertise in HIPAA, EHR interoperability, and data governance. Despite this, I spend 30+ hours per week navigating clinical coordination, insurance, pharmacy logistics, and provider communication just to keep my son’s care on track. There are no support systems or labor protections for this role. Most caregivers aren’t industry experts. I am, and it’s still unbearable.

System Failures I&#039;ve Lived Through:
1. EHRs That Stall Complex Care: Designed for single-provider workflows, EHRs block collaboration on second opinions, trials, or innovative treatments.
2. Burned-Out Clinicians Who Resist Innovation: Creativity, like dietary interventions or off-label use, is often dismissed, even when evidence-backed.
3. Trauma Ignored: Caregivers navigating crisis after crisis need trauma-informed policies. Right now, we’re invisible.

I do not believe the technology is broken.

What is broken however, is the process. Specifically the call centers that are constantly cold calling seniors about their Medicare Coverage, and the year-round Special Election Periods that enable people to change their plans any time they want.

Want to fix the millions of marketing complaints? Get Joe Namath off the TV, find a way to stop the cold calls, and end the non-stop SEPs that allow the churning.

I can promise you the local small-time brokers are not the problem. Its the SEPs that ENABLE the churning, and the billion dollar call centers using speed dialers cold calling people that are.

I have 2-3 clients a day calling me, all saying the same thing &quot;Dave, I just got a cold call from someone saying that they&#039;re from Medicare, and there is NEW things happening, and I should change me plan!&quot;


I am a small time broker, that works exclusively in my community. I do not cross state lines. I have relationships with every one of my clients. I promise you, you are focusing on the wrong thing. Start  with the non-stop SEPs, then crack down on the cold calls.

Once that is fixed, sure update the website, launch Blue Button 3.0 and allow broker-developers to create their own API.

But that is not going to stop the abuse from the cold callers churning during decades long SEPs.

Thank you for listening.">Hello,

Thank you for asking for comments about &quot;how best to advance a seamless, secure, and patient-centered digital health infrastructure.&quot;

My experience comes from providing caregiver to my father (diabetes) and mother (assisted living) who both passed several years ago. I work in information technology (remote monitoring, cybersecurity, AI, entrepreneurship). I have tested and used advancements related to managing chronic care and proactive self-care.

My comment is to look for platforms, products and services that are proven and led by leadership teams who understand the healthcare landscape. One such product I&#039;ve used is the Addison Care platform (Addison specifically) from Electronic Caregiver (ECG). ECG knows the chronic care market and has enrolled patients in Medicaid, Medicare, and private pay. They have partnerships with leading technology companies and are scaling their business through the use of avatars that provide AI-supported care to patients and caregivers. ECG is a leader in terms of intellectual property (27 patents) so incorporating their technology can be done by other parties.

There will continue to be an expanding ecosystem in information health technology. Choosing wisely among initial players will help everyone build more a more seamless, secure, and patient-centered digital health infrastructure.

Fully disclosure: I am an investor in ECG.

Thank you.">Greetings,

As an independent practicing physician and former board member of the Independent Physician 
Association of America, I commend CMS and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
(CMMI) for the release of your visionary strategy, “Make America Healthy Again.” This 
framework—grounded in prevention, patient empowerment, and choice—represents a critical 
inflection point in transforming healthcare delivery and payment models across the nation.
Digital innovation will be essential to actualize your three strategic pillars. The first two—
promoting evidence-based protocols for prevention and wellness along with empowering 
individuals to achieve their health goals—depend upon building a complete longitudinal health 
record for every patient. This record is foundational to unlocking the full potential of digital 
innovation with Clinical Decision Support, Predictive Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. 
Together, these tools enable the delivery of Precision Medicine and Personalized Healthcare at 
scale.
To support this transformation, I respectfully offer the following recommendations:

Our comments focus on the potential of digital therapeutics (DTx) to improve maternal mental health (MMH) outcomes and the necessary federal policy infrastructure to support their effective use.

A notable example is MamaLift Plus, the first FDA-approved DTx for maternal mental health, which integrates evidence-based screening and treatment into a mobile app. Designed to promote open engagement and reduce stigma, it also features EMR integration and care team coordination. Clinical evidence shows it can divert two-thirds of cases from progressing into severe depression.

Recommendations for CMS Action
Standardize EMR Functionality: CMS should require primary care and OB EMRs to include clinical prompts based on evidence-based guidelines, such as routine screeners for maternal depression and anxiety. This standardization would ensure consistent care delivery and generate actionable clinical data for research.
Reimbursement Clarity for DTx: The 2025 Physician Fee Schedule introduces coding for digital mental health therapeutic (DMHT) devices, but without a national reimbursement framework, CMS risks fragmented implementation. Deferring to the seven regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may lead to inconsistent reimbursement rates and deter adoption. A unified billing policy is nee...

The internet&#039;s incredible success and interoperability are built upon foundational protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP. These protocols define how data is transmitted and secured, allowing countless different applications and services to communicate seamlessly, regardless of the underlying hardware or software. This model offers a powerful parallel for the future of healthcare interoperability.

Currently, the healthcare landscape is fragmented by proprietary systems and varying data exchange methods, creating significant barriers to efficient, secure, and comprehensive patient care. Mandating or favoring specific platforms stifles innovation, creates vendor lock-in, and ultimately hinders the fluid exchange of critical patient information across different healthcare providers and systems.

Instead, CMS should focus its efforts on developing and enforcing a robust set of common, vendor-agnostic protocols that define:

FOR PATIENT-PROTECTION AND HOSPITAL PREPAREDNESS

PROBLEM:
U.S. Healthcare is fragile due to its heavy dependence on interconnected IT systems, with continuous ransomware cyberattacks leading to frequent hospital outages impacting hundreds of thousands of patients.  To date current attempts to decrease this fragility have been reactive to individual events and government guidance reports, leaving the state of healthcare cybersecurity protection as both unmeasured and unknown.    

To be specific, at its core the U.S. healthcare system consists of interstate hospital systems, intrastate hospital systems, and independent hospitals.  The independent hospitals are mostly rural, and are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks which can create severe continuity-of-care disruptions and even hospital closures - leaving entire communities without timely healthcare responsiveness for acute events.  

SOLUTION:

Working closely with a CMS threat intelligence (CTI) expert who provided requirements and originally developed the idea, we have used state-of-the-art U.S. technology to create a cybersecurity measurement system that can quantitatively measure cybersecurity metrics and provide a summary cybersecurity rating FOR ALL U.S. HOSPITALS thus providing measurement data and understanding about how best to proactively protect U.S. hospitals. We can thus proactively identify problems at hospitals in advance to prevent and deter cyberattacks instead... [truncated]">U.S. HEALTHCARE CYBERSECURITY MEASUREMENT

With the focus on empowering seniors to manage their health journey, it is critical to have a foundational AI-driven platform taking an enterprise-wide approach, cautiously. However, most seniors are not technologically prepared to navigate digital applications but they are familiar with their provider&#039;s EHR system,  MyChart. as an example.  For those who want access to their medical records in real time, MyChart is readily available.  

Why not utilize this application making it user friendly for patients to independently access their information at a designated, privately enclosed area at their doctor&#039;s clinic the same way they can do so at home?

With proper education, guidance and simple step by step instructions, access can be readily available. Digital tools are sprouting all over and of great concern.  Besides being cost-prohibitive, the risks are many. The service delivered for the patient&#039;s benefit maybe seen as eliminating the paperwork for staff but will likely increase the cost of medical care overall.

AI is designed to improve efficiency on repetitive functions. Access to medical records must be protected.

While these reflections are informed by my experience, they represent my personal perspective and not the official views of my department or employer.

Oral health continues to be siloed from most national health IT and care coordination strategies, despite its undeniable connection to systemic health. Dental providers often operate with electronic dental records (EDRs) that are not interoperable with medical electronic health records (EHRs) or health information exchanges (HIEs). This fragmentation contributes to missed opportunities for care coordination, burdensome documentation processes, and preventable disparities in access and outcomes—particularly for Medicaid-enrolled populations.

To better align with technology-enabled, value-based care, I encourage federal agencies to:

Integrate oral health into national interoperability frameworks and clarify that dental data should be part of health information exchanges and TEFCA implementation.

Support funding and incentives for dental-medical data integration, especially in safety-net settings like FQHCs, school-based programs, and rural clinics.

Encourage adoption of shared clinical terminology and coding systems, including ICD-10 and SNODENT, across EDRs and EHRs to enable coordinated care planning.

RE: Request for Information – CMS-0042-NC, Digital Health, Interoperability, and Technology for Medicare Beneficiaries

To whom it may concern,

On behalf of the Medical Alert Monitoring Association (MAMA), the national voice of the personal emergency response services (PERS) industry, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on CMS-0042-NC. Our association represents technology companies and monitoring providers that serve millions of vulnerable Americans, including Medicare beneficiaries living with chronic illness, limited mobility, or other risk factors for injury, hospitalization, or social isolation.

We commend CMS and ASTP/ONC for advancing the national conversation around equitable digital health access and interoperability. We urge you to recognize the essential role PERS plays as an established, scalable, and underutilized tool for achieving the core goals outlined in this RFI: improving health outcomes, reducing costs, and empowering patient-centered care for seniors and individuals with disabilities.

The Value of PERS in a Digital Health Ecosystem

PERS devices and monitoring services are already digital health products. They provide 24/7 access to emergency help and wellness interventions, often integrating with wearable sensors, home-based devices, and remote monitoring platforms. These services are life-saving for patients ... [truncated]">Medical Alert Monitoring Association (MAMA) Response to CMS-0042-NC

Product Recommendation #1. Build a Medicare Healthy Life App and make it available for free for Medicare FFS enrollees. Include diet management, exercise goals and tracking, nutrition information, social and gamification components, and possibly monetary or gift incentives. Most people lack access to powerful health improvement tools, but Medicare FFS individuals have the most limited access to a tool that is integrated with their claims, health status and coverage rules. If CMS issues an RFP to develop this product with objective engagement and lifestyle improvement objectives, industry will respond and deliver. The product should include special features for dual eligible beneficiaries (Medicare and Medicaid) and chronically ill beneficiaries as these populations require the most health management support and contribute disproportionately to preventable adverse outcomes and costs. This project could be new, or could build on the progress CMS has made with mymedicare, the Medicare Beneficiary Portal, and the Medicare coverage app. If CMS merely publishes standards and strategies and hopes the industry will &quot;step up,&quot; this initiative will not be effective.

I would like seniors to have the ability to know when their identity is used to file a claim.  The recent catheter scam, where beneficiaries were hit with copayment bills for goods and services never ordered by their physician and not needed, demonstrates the vulnerability that Medicare beneficiaries have.  The reporting process for potential fraud is cumbersome and requires significant manual intervention.  

PC-9 (b)Blue Button
Blue Button can be transformed to be a sentinel for senior to warn them about potential fraud and identity theft committed in their name.  Castlestone has already designed the application to automate the Blue Button query process and use that to identify potential fraudulent claims, and provide a simple interface for seniors to confirm or deny that the claim is legitimate.

vulnerability that Medicare beneficiaries have.  The reporting process for potential fraud 
is cumbersome and requires significant manual intervention.  
PC-9 (b)Blue Button
Blue Button can be transformed to be a sentinel for senior to warn them about potential 
fraud and identity theft committed in their name.  Castlestone has already designed the 
application to automate the Blue Button query process and use that to identify potential 
fraudulent claims, and provide a simple interface for seniors to confirm or deny that the 
claim is legitimate.  
PC-14 Digital Identity
Castlestone has developed and deployed payment network technology to verify digital 
identity, verify outpatient claims and use of beneficiary and provider identities.  Virtual 
identification cards using the digital wallet capabilities already in place.

I am writing to provide input on the “Health Technology Ecosystem” Request for Information (HT RFI) on behalf of an initiative focused on enabling secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence across healthcare institutions.

We have developed a federated infrastructure for AI training and digital health delivery that aligns closely with the goals of CMS and ONC. Our system is designed to support innovation in areas such as surgical robotics, AI-assisted diagnostics, and software-based therapeutics—particularly those not currently accommodated by Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) or Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) reimbursement categories.

Key Features of Our Architecture:
	•	Federated Learning: Local AI models train on-site using protected data. Encrypted updates—not raw data—are aggregated securely, preserving privacy while improving model performance.
	•	Cryptographic Identity Framework: Ensures only authorized healthcare nodes (e.g., surgical robots, EMRs, imaging devices) contribute to the learning network.
	•	Immutable Audit Trail: Participation, model contributions, and data access events are recorded transparently via distributed ledger technology to support regulatory and institutional compliance.
	•	Smart Governance Capabilities: Optional rule enforcement (e.g., data use policies, jurisdictional access controls) can be built into the system via programmable logic.
	•	Platform Agnostic: Compatible with existing EMR ... [truncated]">To Whom It May Concern,

Existing apps (e.g., Medicare’s Blue Button-enabled tools, condition-specific platforms) provide basic data aggregation but lack caregiver-centric features. While apps like iBlueButton help beneficiaries access claims data, they fail to address critical gaps:
Training modules: 94% of caregivers lack formal training, yet no app integrates skill-building (e.g., wound care, dementia communication) with real-time expert feedback.
Mental health integration: Most apps omit burnout screening or connections to licensed therapists, despite caregivers facing 40-70% higher depression rates.
Task deconstruction: Complex care tasks (e.g., transitioning to assisted living) remain overwhelming; AI-driven tools to break tasks into daily checklists are rare.

PC-4: Missing Features and CMS Workflow Opportunities
a. Critical gaps in existing apps:
Gamified training platforms: Apps should reward caregivers for completing training modules (e.g., medication safety, crisis response) to address the 94% training gap. Current solutions lack adaptive learning or certification tracking.
Integrated mental health workflows: No app combines symptom tracking with automated referrals to low-cost teletherapy, despite evidence reducing caregiver depression by 37%.
Interoperable task managers: Tools to auto-populate care plans using CMS data (e.g., claims, EHRs) are missing, forcing caregivers to manually reconcile information.

1. There should be absolutely no digital ID requirement for any human being to access healthcare in America, ever.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever.

3. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if AI or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted.

4. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard.

Improve the PBP benefits data – fill in information “gaps”. The more detailed, accurate and up to date the PBP information, the more reliable and useful source it can be in answering the coverage and benefits information needs of both beneficiaries and those that are soon to become ones. More specifically:
For some service categories the PBP dataset includes only MIN and MAX cost shares, which can differ significantly, but does not list the specific cost shares for more specific services. For example, in many plans advanced radiology has a MIN copayment of $0 and a MAX of many hundreds of dollars (ie $700+) but no information as to what copayment applies to which service (or settings). 
For some plans, benefits are missing. For example, according to its EOC, plan H2001_125_0 (NV) offers an OTC benefit with $40 quarterly allowance, which is missi... [truncated]">The following comments are in the context of healthcare coverage and cost transparency.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to any federal initiatives or regulations within the proposed “Health Technology Ecosystem” that would infringe upon basic human rights—particularly the rights to medical privacy, parental authority, and bodily autonomy.

My concerns and expectations are as follows:

1. No Digital ID Requirement:
No individual should ever be required to possess or use a digital ID to access healthcare services in the United States. Healthcare is a human right and should never be conditioned upon compliance with digital identity systems.

2. Protection Against Biometric Data Mandates:
No one should be compelled to provide biometric data—such as facial recognition, fingerprints, retinal scans, or voice samples—in order to access healthcare. This is an unacceptable invasion of privacy.

3. Ban on Mandated Wearable Technology:
Under no circumstances should wearable devices be mandated for any health-related purpose. The principle of informed consent must always prevail. Any attempt to enforce wearable technology undermines personal autonomy and sets a dangerous precedent.

4. Right to Be Forgotten:
Patients must retain control over their personal health data. If artificial intelligence or other technological tools are used to collect or process data, individuals must have the right to request that such data be deleted entirely. Data collection should be opt-in, not opt-out, and subject to full transparency.

These are not radic... [truncated]">To Whom It May Concern,

When it comes to health technology my primary concern is privacy rights for patients as well as parental rights. My requests are pretty straightforward:

1. There should be absolutely no digital ID requirement for any human being to access healthcare in America, ever.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever.

3. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard.

4. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if AI or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

My parkinson&#039;s prevents me from working. I have memory problems related to the disease, so I am on social security and disability. Last year, I almost lost my disability benefits because we couldn&#039;t get a copy of my records from two providers&#039; offices—Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology and Fairview Health Systems. 

We signed several forms for a copy of my records. We made numerous calls to follow up. We drove to the clinics in person and made requests. We argued with people over the phone and made complaints locally. The records never came. My wife ended up hacking the multiple MyChart accounts and retrieving PDFs, which she then sent to my email account, one page at a time. 

We were exhausted and frustrated, and I almost lost my disability benefit. 

My wife made two complaints to the ONC/ASTP information blocking website. We have never received confirmation of the submission, nor have we received any follow-up or resolution. This is fraud and misrepresentation. Why have a website if you never follow up or take any enforcement action? 

As my wife says, in Minnesota, we don&#039;t have HIE; we have Epic, and that system is tuned only to the business agendas of the local health systems, not to the needs of patients ...

The patient and their caregiver, who may have been working as well, then need FMLA paperwork filled out so they can keep their income going during this time of upheaval. 

TIMELY SUBMISSION OF FMLA PAPERWORK IS CRITICAL IN PREVENTING UNNECESSARY UNEMPLOYMENT.

When delays occur—often due to confusion over employer-specific forms, uncertainty about which provider should complete the documentation, or administrative hurdles within healthcare systems—individuals may exhaust their paid leave or be penalized for absences, ultimately risking job loss. 

Often, an independent person who is working may not have a primary care/General Provider. Once leaving the hospital, the Primary Care may not have access to the hospital records to fill out the form accurately. And hospital staff may not be able to provide it after discharge without requesting from medical records, which can cause additonal delay.

A streamlined, standardized FMLA form that can be quickly completed and signed within the Electronic Health Record would reduce these delays, ensuring that those eligible for job-protected leave can access it promptly. 

By simplifying the process,...

I had medical power of attorney and was involved in my parents&#039; care during their stay at two assisted living facilities near me. They recently passed away at the ages of 88 and 92 from complications due to dementia. I visited my parents several times a week, and took them to doctor appointments and the hospital as needed. But I didn&#039;t have easy access to their health history, so I didn&#039;t always know how to answer questions that their doctors had (and that my parents couldn&#039;t answer because they didn&#039;t remember, at this point), especially because they moved from Florida to Indiana to be closer to myself and other family members. 

When the time comes for family to care for their loved ones, there needs to be one place to go to reference that patient&#039;s health history. Even if it requires some proof of relationship and the right to do so (patient privacy is the most important thing and must be maintained).

How many patient portals must a caregiver attempt to gain access to?  What if the patient never set it up, because back when they were seen, they didn&#039;t think they needed it (or didn&#039;t know how)? Now, an aging parent with cognitive decline or other issues that prevent them from being able to complete such tasks suddenly has no health history, in effect.

I am concerned about the following points:

1. There should be absolutely no digital ID requirement for any human being to access healthcare in America, ever.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever.

3. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard.

4. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if AI or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted.

In others words, I value my privacy. I want to protect it and take it back where it has been abused.

1. Introduction
As an academic, international advisor, and standards committee member with decades of experience in biomedical engineering, data interoperability, and ethical AI, I commend CMS for initiating this RFI to better understand and shape the digital health landscape for Medicare beneficiaries. I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on two areas I believe are critically underrepresented in the current proposal: data provenance and metadata for device-generated health data, and the governance, surveillance, and ethical integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

2. Background
CMS&#039;s initiative focuses on expanding the use of EHR systems and the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) to support interoperability across providers, payors, and patients. While this is a necessary step, the current draft lacks strong articulation of how the quality and source of health data are tracked, and how advanced AI systems—already being used in many clinical contexts—will be safely governed and integrated under Medicare reimbursement structur...

When it comes to health technology my primary concern is privacy rights for patients as well as parental rights. My requests are pretty straightforward:

1. There should be absolutely no digital ID requirement for any human being to access healthcare in America, ever.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever.

3. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard.

4. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if AI or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted.

Dear CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz and the Health IT Modernization Team,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the Request for Information (RFI) regarding
CMS&#039;s Health Information Technology Modernization initiative.
On behalf of the Uraali Refaluwasch Association (URAALI), a culturally rooted non-profit

Marani Health, a digital health innovator focused on maternal and fetal care, appreciates the opportunity to provide input on CMS and ASTP/ONC’s Request for Information regarding digital health tools and health technology infrastructure.

We strongly support the Administration’s vision for a patient-centered, interoperable health technology ecosystem. We urge CMS and ONC to explicitly prioritize maternal health in its digital health strategy, and offer the following recommendations based on our work deploying prenatal monitoring technologies that serve Medicaid populations:
________________________________________
1. Enable Broader Data Access for Maternal Monitoring (PC-2, PC-9)
Our patients and providers face data fragmentation, often unable to unify pregnancy-specific clinical data (e.g., fetal heart rate, fundal height, weight gain trends) across systems. Integration of maternal and fetal data from devices and EMRs into APIs like Blue Button 2.0 would enable more holistic and timely care—especially valuable for managing high-risk pregnancies.
Recommendation: Expand API-supported data types to include pregnancy-related vitals, structured OB notes, and fetal monitoring outputs. Enable seamless third-party access through patient consent.

2. Prioritize Remote Monitoring in Covered Digital Health (PC-1, VB-3)
Non-invasive remote monitoring enables early detection of conditions like pre... [truncated]">Comment on CMS-0042-NC, Submitted by Marani Health

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I serve as Chief Medical O Ưicer for Primary 
Record, a patient-centered platform designed to help individuals and families aggregate, 
organize, and share their personal health information across fragmented healthcare 
systems. We serve diverse populations including complex pediatric patients, patients 
navigating assisted living, Medicaid/Medicare recipients, patients who require private care 
navigation services and others whose care requires cross-system data coordination that is 
rarely achievable through conventional EHR interoperability alone. 
While signiﬁcant policy progress has been made through TEFCA, ONC certiﬁcation, and 
FHIR API adoption, I respectfully submit that the patient experience remains profoundly 
fragmented. The technical architecture exists, but the human workﬂow burden remains 
largely unresolved. Most patients still struggle to collect comprehensive records, despite 
having the legal right to access them. In fact, many we see that are ﬁghting through

We believe physicians deserve a modern, automated solution that reflects the realities of how they practice and interact with today’s digital systems. Too often, clinicians spend valuable time updating profile information across numerous disconnected directories, a process that creates duplication, inconsistency, and ultimately frustration. These consequences lead to delayed patient access and ultimately inferior care. Currently, physicians are required to navigate a multitude of credentialing and licensing processes. Unfortunately, these sites can be poorly designed, leaving physicians uncertain about which details will remain private and which will be publicly accessible. The accessibility of physicians’ personal information online can pose significant safety problems, including identity theft and harassment.

RE: Request for Information – Health Technology Ecosystem (Document Number 2025-08701)

As a federal employee supporting Medicare operations and enterprise transformation—and as the primary caregiver to a Medicare beneficiary—I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development of a more responsive and equitable health technology ecosystem. My professional work focuses on the alignment of business processes with modern technology strategies, including the use of artificial intelligence, automation, and data-driven tools in Medicare programs. Personally, I have witnessed how critical it is for beneficiaries to have access to technologies that support timely, independent health decisions. I respectfully offer the following comments for consideration:

1. Self-Monitoring Tools Are Essential for Medicare Beneficiaries

Medicare beneficiaries living with chronic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (Afib), hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure should be empowered to monitor their vital signs at home—without relying on a nurse or physician to perform the measurement. Access to vetted, high quality, easy-to-use tools such as blood pressure cuffs, heart rate monitors, glucometers, and pulse oximeters, along with mechanisms for directly transmitting this data to care teams in real time, is vital to early detection of complications and effective disease management.

As both a business architect and a caregiver, I believe that real-time, self-... [truncated]">Public Comment Submission

When it comes to health technology my primary concern is privacy rights for patients as well as parental rights. My requests are pretty straightforward:

1. There should be absolutely no digital ID requirement for any human being to access healthcare in America, ever.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever.

3. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard.

4. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if AI or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Conclusion:
This RFI seeks stakeholder input to help CMS and ASTP/ONC “build on the existing policy framework to drive large-scale adoption of health management and care navigation applications, reduce barriers to data access and exchange, realize the potential of recent innovations in healthcare that promote better health outcomes, and accelerate progress towards a patient-centric learning health system.” 

Formed in November 2023, the Accelerating Care Transformation (ACT) initiative builds on 20 years of successful collaborative work toward these same goals involving HHS (including CMS, ONC, and many other HHS agencies), VA, and many private stakeholders. ACT provides proven frameworks, methods, tools, and collaborations that can be applied to addressing – individually and collectively - many of the challenges and opportunities identified in the RFI. For example, improving patient-centered workflows and outcomes (e.g., population health, patient/care team experience, costs) within and across targets and organizations, surfacing and disseminating best practices and tools, breaking down silos and building cross-stakeholder consensus, and supporting standards-based exchange and use of computable/ interoperable data, evidence, and information management tools.

I do not want wearable technology to be be mandated under any circumstances for any American. The standard must aways be informed consent.

If AI tools are being used to  gather data on a patient, it should be the individual’s right NOT to participate in AI and to have their data deleted.

I believe in privacy rights, bodily sovereignty, choice, and informed consent for all Americans.

I. Introduction  
OneSelf Technology appreciates the opportunity to respond to CMS’s Request for 
Information (RFI) on the future of the health technology ecosystem. We commend CMS and 
HHS for recognizing the critical need to engage consumers more directly in their care, whi le 
also modernizing digital infrastructure to support equitable, cost -effective, and outcomes -
driven healthcare delivery.  
Despite decades of investment in enterprise health IT systems, most patients —and their 
families —remain disconnected from their own health data, care plans, and treatment 
decisions. Digital tools that prioritize the needs of healthcare organizations often f ail to 
deliver meaningful value at the individual level, especially for populations managing 
chronic conditions, navigating complex care pathways, or facing health disparities. This 
persistent gap must be addressed.  ... [truncated]">1

I had a normal course of prenatal care, experienced gestational diabetes, and was expected to deliver a normal vaginal birth at the hospital where my OB doctor practiced in Shakopee, MN. When I started active labor, I was discouraged from entering the hospital; now I know that the hospital didn&#039;t have any beds for laboring soon-to-be new moms like me. Unfortunately, that instruction created a problem for me later because my water had broken, and I was leaking amniotic fluid, something I reported to my OB office. 

Later that day, the contractions became more frequent, and I again called for instructions. This time, I was told to drive to the hospital. However, before we could get to my car, I received a call telling us not to go to the hospital where I had planned to deliver my child. Instead, I was diverted to a Twin Cities hospital almost an hour from where I live. We got in the car and started to drive, but again, we received a call telling us that there were no beds and to go to a different hospital, this time in the southern metro suburb.

I realized I did not separate out the below paragraphs. This point may be more of a longer term goal.

CMS and ASTP/ONC should explicitly include care delivery organizations (CDOs)—including those structured as independent physician associations (IPAs) or affiliated with payers—within the definition of “providers” required to adopt API-enabled Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT). This inclusion is essential to reflect the reality of evolving healthcare delivery models, enhance interoperability, and ensure patients and consumers have consistent access to their electronic health information.
CMS should also require all CDOs submitting data to CMS—particularly for programs such as quality reporting, value-based care, and risk adjustment—to use CEHRT with robust support for both CDA and FHIR APIs. To reduce reliance on PDFs and manual processes, CMS should accelerate the transition to FHIR-based submission workflows by providing clear implementation guides and financial incentives. These actions will improve data timeliness, accuracy, and patient outcomes.

FHIR and CDA education should be done to flow from the parent organizations of provider health systems and payer-affiliated care delivery organizations down to frontline staff, including insurance verification specialists and certified medical assistants.

No. Obtaining records is unnecessarily burdensome or not possible. The available patient portals block access to many areas of the records. I am required to fill out burdensome forms to ask permission from health care organizations to obtain my own records, and sometimes they never send them. Please revise the patient user login profile requirements to enable patient access to all areas of the records. There should NOT be separate systems for providers and patients to access medical records.

b. If not, in what contexts or for what workflows would it be most valuable to use one portal or system to access all such health information? 

I would greatly benefit from access to the system that stores the radiology images. It is very difficult to get the complete set of images that I want to share with other providers or family members. There should NOT be separate systems for providers and patients to access radiology imaging studies. Patients should not be required to request permission from anyone to obtain their records, fill out forms to obtain records, or jump through hoops to get them. Additionally, the raw images should be automatically released to the patient as soon as they are captured, before the patient leaves the testing site.

CMS-0042-NC. CMS Building Foundational Infrastructure for Digital Healthcare Ecosystem
You are ALREADY building it, so that the survey is a dog and pony show by default. You are already decided that this anti-human outrage is going to take place – all seniors without electronics be damned. I don’t have ANY electronics and use library computers to type this text surrounded by noisy savages and I am not a native speaker. Your form does not even bother to include grammar correction. I am embarrassed to find mistakes later on – do not have time now.

I have very few documents on me pertaining to medical fraud/CMS on my flash drive in the library. Ultimately, I am not nearly ready to send my comments, but running out of time. The bottom line is iron clad and will never change in this lifetime or another: anyone whatsoever peddling more electronics is enemy of humanity. No if, no maybe.

A patient-controlled global medical record is needed that automatically preserves the original record including test results. Patients are in a unique position to collate all their medical records in one place. The app should allow connection to any EHR or app the patient chooses, and any new information generated by external health care organizations-especially EHRs-should be pushed to the patients&#039; global record account automatically.

Audit features in EHRs do not protect patients. Many health organizations change the records, including test results and claims diagnosis, after it is discovered the patient had a serious problem or dies, but wasn&#039;t given appropriate medical care. The record is recreated to make it look like the providers did things right when in reality, they ignored the patient&#039;s obvious signs. Old EHRs or old EHR software configurations that lack audit features still in use are used to alter the medical record then imported back into the newer EHR. Fixing this problem would promote patient safety and therefore reduce costs, and prevent fraud. The system currently in place incentivizes poor quality of care because providers know the records can be altered later if something bad happens to the patient.">PC-4 - APPS THAT SHOULD EXIST

Dental Standards Institute (DSI) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Health 
Technology Ecosystem Request for Information. DSI is a nationally recognized, ANSI-
accredited standards development organization dedicated to advancing interoperability and 
patient-centered innovation in oral health care. We strongly support CMS and ONC’s efforts to 
strengthen digital health infrastructure and would like to underscore the critical need to 
include dental health information in this ecosystem. In dentistry today, compliance with 
existing data-sharing laws (HIPAA portability and the 21st Century Cures Act’s interoperability 
mandates) is lagging, hindering patients’ rights and coordinated care. We urge strong 
enforcement of these existing regulations in the dental sector and adoption of open ... [truncated]">Comment on CMS-0042-NC: Health

This aligns with the CMS burden reduction agenda, promotes efficient EHR use, and enhances nursing contributions to team-based, high-quality care.

1. Streamlines and Standardizes Documentation
•	With standardized codes and concepts for common nursing problems, goals, and interventions, nurses spend less time searching for or free-texting terms in EHRs.
•	Drop-downs, templates, and clinical decision support (CDS) can be pre-populated with ICNP-SNOMED CT terms, making documentation faster and more intuitive.

2. Reduces Redundant Data Entry
•	Structured nursing data can be reused across workflows (e.g., care plans, quality reporting, shift handoffs), minimizing the need to re-document the same information in multiple places.
•	It supports interoperable reuse, meaning data collected in one system can auto-populate or sync with another, which is crucial for home health, post-acute, or long-term care nurses.
3. Enables More Intelligent EHR Interfaces
•	ICNP-SNOMED CT-coded data enables smarter, context-aware clinical decision support, nudging nurses toward evidence-based actions without adding extra documentation tasks.
•	Over time, this could allow automation of routine documentation (e.g., “standard fall precautions initiated”) based...

Rainfall Health’s AI platform reduces provider burden by automating compliance monitoring, standardizing workflows, and transforming raw data into actionable insights that align with CMS quality and reimbursement models. Our solution supports PR-7 and PR-8 by streamlining clinical data responsibilities and guiding both providers and payers through shared, metrics-driven workflows. For Health Systems that are worried about the burden of additional compliance and reporting, this is a technological advancement that brings down time to readiness to under 10 days for mandated models.

We urge CMS to prioritize partnerships with vendors that:

- Deliver real-time, mandate-aligned data, in a standardized format for transparency of planning and allocation of resources

- Leverage AI to make compliance and quality easy to track and report

- Enable seamless interoperability without disrupting existing EMR systems.

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this request for information. I am a board certified pathologist, and I spent the last ten years of my career before retirement as a medical officer in the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Prior to my work at ASPE I was at CMS where I worked on the Doctors Office Quality Information Technology Project and its continuation through the Quality Improvement Organization’s 8th scope of work. Based on this experience, our health technology ecosystem is limited in its performance for the following reasons.

First, it does not consider the tremendous complexity of diagnosing and treating the numerous disease combinations found in Medicare patients. While at ASPE I had access to a comprehensive database of Medicare claims data as well as extensive access to analytical tools and statisticians. The central finding of this research is that patients are surprisingly unique in their medical histories even at the national level. For example, the most complex 35% of Medicare patients account for approximately 80% of Medicare expenditures, and the national cell size of patients with similar disease combinations in this group is approximately 5 individuals. Each of these distinct combinations is small and scattered across the nation. One way to view this statistical fact is that patients with one of the many combinations of multiple diagnosis would fall into ... [truncated]">File Code: CMS-0042-NC

IntroductIon
We are witnessing a golden age in health care as new diagnostic 
modalities coupled with artificial intelligence and machine 
learning (AI/ML) improve our understanding of disease and 
our ability to care for patients. This era is unique in that we 
are experiencing innovation in three synergistic areas: new 
data types, new data sources, and novel actionable information 
through data manipulation. First, an explosion in diagnostic 
data provides fundamentally new types of information. These 
data include not only the familiar “omics” and imaging data 
categories (although greatly extended), but they also include 
entirely new data types that are often generated in the patient’s 
environment through cell phone and wearable technologies.[1,2] 
These new data types may be amon... [truncated]">ISSN : 2229-5089

Rune Labs strongly supports this objective and offers the following key points drawn from our work with StrivePD - the leading digital management platform for Parkinson’s disease (PD):

1. Passive, consumer‑grade sensors meaningfully reduce acute‑care utilization. In a Kaiser Permanente pilot, StrivePD users experienced a 42 % reduction in emergency‑department visits compared with matched controls. We encourage CMS to recognize such digital biomarkers as legitimate measures for Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and expand Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) codes beyond musculoskeletal use cases.

2. API‑first data exchange should explicitly include Patient‑Generated Health Data (PGHD). StrivePD’s Apple HealthKit pipeline already produces FHIR resources that can flow into Blue Button 2.0. CMS should add PGHD to USCDI v4 and require Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) to support those data classes.

3. Digital identity rules must preserve consumer‑friendly sign‑on methods. Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers (MBIs) and NIST IAL2/AAL2 requirements should allow third‑party authenticators such as Apple ID to avoid disenfranchising older beneficiaries.

4. Value‑Based Care models need timely, device‑collected outcomes. Continuous gait‑qua...

Tendo appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to CMS/HHS 

In operating a national healthcare marketplace serving self-insured employers, we have consistently observed that informed patients and navigators make value-driven decisions when they can compare cost, quality, and convenience. Enabling this transparency creates healthy market competition, drives efficiency, and reduces overall healthcare costs.

The RFI, particularly in Section PC-12a(1-5), highlights critical use cases such as “finding the right provider,” access to “binding costs,” and visibility into “quality metrics.” These goals directly align with building a shoppable healthcare experience—one that allows patients to see the total cost of an episode of care and compare provider quality in a meaningful, procedure-specific way.

Section TD-19 highlights the current limitations of price transparency. We believe the next policy evolution is to make this transparency actionable—enabling patients to not only compare options but also purchase care directly. In other words, to treat healthcare like e-commerce.

Furthermore, Sections VB-2 and VB-10 emphasize the need for technology that supports clinical quality measurement, risk adjustment, and value-based models like episode-of-care bundles. These goals are best served by platforms that streamline care delivery and payment through bundled, pre-negotiated, and quality-as...

Tendo appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to CMS/HHS on advancing digital health technology infrastructure and policy for Medicare beneficiaries.  We purposely focused on a key set of questions and topics most relevant to areas we have operating expertise in working with some of the nation&#039;s largest health systems and self-insured employers.
Context:
CMS’s Request for Information on the Health Technology Ecosystem - calls for strategies to enhance patient-facing digital tools, improve data access and interoperability, support provider and payer adoption of innovative applications, and advance price transparency and value-based care.  This proposal demonstrates the need for technology driven consumerism and natural market dynamics in healthcare that create improved access and address affordability.
Aligning to these themes, Tendo has consistently observed while operating a national healthcare marketplace serving self-insured employers, that informed patients and navigators make value-driven decisions when they can compare cost, q...

comments for your consideration relative to  Docket (CMS -2025 -0050) Digital Health RFI .

PHP services. Unfortunately, Medicare members are not currently afforded the same 
virtual treatment options as non -Medicare members, unless they are able to pay out of 
pocket.

https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/16/2025-08701/request-for-information-health-technology-ecosystem

Under 3b &amp; d in the Digital Identity section, HHS poses the following question, &quot;Regarding digital identity credentials ... What impact would mandatory credentials have on a nationwide provider directory?&quot; HFDF and I are resolute in our conviction that digital identity must never be a requirement to access healthcare for any American citizen. The entire program should be an opt-in program barring mandates of any kind. However, should the system come to pass, then HHS must provide a valid mechanism to opt-out of such a digital ID requirement without impacting the type or quality of healthcare available to every individual.

more uniformity in how health information is gathered, shared , and used. However, 
over the past decade , end-users have found that new technical approaches and

We commend the agencies’ focus on improving digital health infrastructure and encourage the inclusion of maternal mental health (MMH) as a key priority throughout the digital health policy landscape.  Digital health tools play a critical role in improving maternal mental health outcomes and addressing the maternal morbidity and mortality crisis in the United States. Mental health, including suicide and overdose, is a leading cause of maternal mortality in the U.S. and globally. Suicide remains the leading cause of direct maternal deaths in the first postnatal year, often occurring during the second half of that year. Maternal mental health conditions—such as perinatal depression, anxiety, and postpartum psychosis—not only represent some of the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth, but also significantly increase the risk of suicide. Digital innovations present unique opportunities to bridge care gaps, especially for underserved and remote populations. One such approach is collaborative care—a team-based model that integrates mental health services into primary and obstetric care through shared care plans, regular case reviews, and measurement-based treatment. This model improves screening, diagnosis, and access to timely treatment, and when paired with digital tools, c...

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the CMS RFI related to Information Blocking and the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. I am writing to strongly recommend that CMS enhance the current requirement for publishing a practice’s service base URL to also include a complete listing of all associated providers at the National Provider Identifier (NPI) level.

The current requirement, while a meaningful step forward, does not sufficiently support patients in identifying or accessing health information tied to a specific provider involved in their care. In large or multi-specialty organizations, patients often receive treatment from a wide range of professionals under a single practice or facility umbrella. Simply publishing the practice-level URL obscures the link between an individual provider and the patient’s health data, thereby weakening the spirit of patient-directed interoperability that the Cures Act aims to promote.

By requiring the inclusion of NPI-level detail alongside the base URL, patients will be empowered to direct their health information requests to the exact provider on record for their care. This refinement would help eliminate confusion, minimize delays, and ensure a more streamlined and transparent process for patients seeking to aggregate or share their medical history, especially in scenarios involving second opinions, transitions of care, or participation in clinical research.

Re: Request for Information; Health Technology Ecosystem  
 
We wish to thank the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services  (CMS) for the opportunity 
to submit public comment s on their Health Technology Ecosystem Request for 
Information.  In these public comments, we focus on ways in which CMS could utilize 
technologies  to enhance patient access, improve interoperability, and streamline identity 
management within healthcare systems. By addressing barriers in data availability, identity 
federation, and API accessibility, CMS can foster a more efficient, patient -centered  digital 
infrastructure that reduces costs and simplifies ca re delivery.  
Praia Health is a US -based tech firm that spun out of one of the largest nonprofit health 
systems to solve a pressing industry need. We help health systems give patients the same 
easy online and mobile tools that have become standard from banks and e-commerce  
industries .

Our mission is to build infrastructure that supports meaningful digital health innovation by ensuring patient-controlled, seamless, and secure data exchange.

In our comment on CMS-0042, we outlined several recommendations grounded in this operational experience. We urged CMS to strengthen implementation quality and enforcement mechanisms for Patient Access APIs, address current fragmentation in digital identity systems, and modernize the Blue Button 2.0 API to bring Traditional Medicare into alignment with Medicare Advantage. We highlighted gaps in current payer API implementations—including missing or inconsistent USCDI elements—and called for rigorous conformance testing, machine-readable validation, and public audits tied to financial incentives. We also recommended API-based EHI export and support for high-assurance digital identity credentials like Login.gov, which would reduce patient login friction, improve fraud monitoring, and increase adoption across the ecosystem.

We also called attention to payer behaviors that mirror information blocking—such as opaque developer registra...

Years of rulemaking and incentives for open access to healthcare information have not solved the problem of patients lacking consistent and easy access to their records. Confusing hurdles force many patients to give up.
Despite the poor progress on open access technology, the overall digitization of healthcare has sped up with providers and payors spending records amounts of money on digital services that don’t follow open standards, create data silos, and create waste and friction. This has also resulted in patients losing control of their data and how it’s used.
CMS and HHS must ensure open documentation and free availability of foundational healthcare frameworks and give patients and their families control over their records.

FMLA and ADA forms on FHIR
To improve the efficiency, consistency, and interoperability of medical certifications under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), CMS should work with the Department of Labor (DOL), ONC, and standards organizations to digitize the FMLA process using open health data standards such as FHIR and  openEHR.
FMLA certification forms (e.g., WH-380 series) currently rely on manual, paper-based workflows that burden clinicians, delay patients&#039; access to job-protected leave, and create administrative overhead for employers. By leveraging HL7 FHIR resources such as Condition, CarePlan, Practitioner, and DocumentReference, the clinical portions of the forms can be automated and exchanged directly from certified EHRs. Additionally, openEHR’s archetype-based approach offers a robust model for long-term storage, computability, and data validation, particularly for complex use cases such as intermittent leave or chronic conditions.
FHIR can support real-time generation and sharing of required certification data through SMART on FHIR apps, while openEHR templates can serve as durable, version-controlled clinical models aligned with existing documentation standards. Integrating these approaches would reduce clinician burnout, speed up patient access to leave, and improve data quality for oversight and policy analysis.
CMS should consider pilot programs or interagency collaborations to:

CMS, researchers, experts, and commenters are losing sight of the forest for the trees.

Despite seamless integration, team-based, patient-centric, value-based, quality improvement, incentivized, digitized, standardized, outcome focused, accessible, burden reduction, patient experience, interoperability, care coordination, social determinants of health, innovation, transformation, leveraging, and technologically enhanced initiatives, many struggle to obtain basic medical care. 

Do the ‘experts’ have secret health care systems? Because It seems like everyone talks about these things but few are doing them.

***To prevent chronic illness, we need our providers to diagnose us in a timely manner.***

Yet, this is often unobtainable. And for reasons unrelated to insurance. It would be helpful to have an app (not owned by the medical provider) such as ChatGPT that is integrated into the EHR. The patient would enter their symptoms, and AI would correlate with the patient&#039;s history to output a list of differential diagnoses and next steps such as testing. This output would be captured into the visit note. This would be highly beneficial and help prevent chronic illness because it would facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis.

An app that allows me to add corrections directly to the providers note is very much needed to prevent medical errors and chronic illness. Even to obtain basic medical treatment. 

It&#039;s impossible to have an accurate medical record. My record is so inaccurate that it seems to be about someone else. When I ask for corrections,  they are usually denied even when I have proof. Or I hear no response about it at all. At the most, I am permitted to add a statement that gets buried in some obscure part of the record that no one reads. And it takes months to get it added. 

Better yet, just let the patient add reason for the visit and symptoms and any test results directly to the provider&#039;s note. This would help ensure i receive quality care.

I think this capability doesn&#039;t exist because the records are set up with intentional errors. Because if the real information was there, the doctor might be questioned for not providing the standard of care.

What specific opportunities and challenges exist to improve accessibility, interoperability and integration of clinical data from different sources to enable more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence?

A key challenge in enabling more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence is the lack of shared agreement in how to communicate clinical research and evidence data throughout all phases of research design, conduct, analysis, and reporting.

Key opportunities are established with the Evidence Based Medicine on FHIR (EBMonFHIR) Implementation Guide and the Scientific Evidence Code System (SEVCO). 

The HL7 FHIR standard (Health Level 7 International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is already accepted and encouraged throughout the CMS/ASTP/ONC efforts noted in this HHS RFI as the standard for health data exchange.  Prior to 2018 there was no equivalent standard to support data exchange for scientific evidence.

In 2018, participants from communities of biomedical/healthcare research, systematic review development, clinical practice guideline development, and clinical decision support development collaborated to obtain approval of HL7 to extend FHIR to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge assets, a project now called EBMonFHIR.

 Our country now has technology using FHIR to integrate health information around each 
patient. Integrating encounter records around the patient is far more efficient than the present, 
historically established non-system that stores patient records in scattered pieces among various 
hospital and medical office EHR databases. 
 
FHIR technology thus can lead to a new system design featuring lifetime health records 
each patient owns and controls, and are exchangeable interoperably and securely. These are 
explicit 21st Century Cures Act goal s; they are mandatory , and they have effectively been ignored 
over the last four years by ASTP/ONC in its TEFCA implementation. 
 
To accomplish what the Cures Act demands, CMS and ONC have the opportunity and

Enabling FHIR-Based Advance Directive Forms Through IP Clearance

Background:
The National Association for Home Care &amp; Hospice (NAHC) stewards widely used advance directive forms across states. These forms often have IP restrictions limiting their digital, interoperable use. CMS can play a pivotal role in negotiating IP clearance and fostering adoption of standardized, FHIR-enabled advance directive forms to improve care coordination and patient empowerment.

Link to the forms that you can click on by state:

https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/financial-legal/free-printable-advance-directives/


Recommendation:
CMS should establish a multi-stakeholder initiative with NAHC, CaringInfo, state health agencies, EHR vendors, and standards organizations (HL7 International, ASTP/ONC, SNOMED International, Regenstrief Institute) to:
1.	Negotiate IP licensing agreements with NAHC and states to permit the use of advance directive forms in interoperable digital formats (FHIR resources).
2.	Support development and publication of FHIR Implementation Guides for advance directive forms aligned with state legal requirements.
3.	Incentivize adoption through Medicare/Medicaid quality programs and EHR  and API CEHRT certification criteria requiring support for FHIR-based advance directives.
4.	Encourage state alignment to harmonize legal and policy frameworks facilitating cross-state interoperability.
5.	Fund education and outreach fo... [truncated]">Extract from part 2 of my comments with ID: CMS-2025-0050-0254

TEFCA with Imaging 
TEFCA should prioritize the inclusion of imaging exchange use cases, leveraging existing IHE profiles such as XDS-I.b, MHD, and AIR. While imaging has historically been excluded from TEFCA’s initial document-focused design, national imaging interoperability is critical for AI workflows, diagnostics, and care coordination.
CMS and ASTP/ONC should partner with organizations like IHE, RSNA, and vendors with FHIR/DICOMweb experience to advance TEFCA-aligned imaging pilots. TEFCA must eventually support imaging for it to be a comprehensive national framework.
Imaging with FHIR 
CMS should promote the adoption of HL7 FHIR for radiology to improve the interoperability, accessibility, and computability of imaging data across care settings. Today, imaging reports are often exchanged in narrative form via CDA or as unstructured PDFs, which limits their usefulness in clinical decision support, care coordination, and patient access.
FHIR resources like ImagingStudy and DiagnosticReport, when integrated with DICOMweb, enable rich, structured, standards-based radiology data exchange. This is essential for emergency response, telehealth, value-based care, and post-acute care.
I recommend CMS encourage the use of FHIR-based APIs for radiology in CEHRT certification, promote the use of DICOM-FHIR mappings, and prioritize structured radiology data in USCDI expansion.

Interoperability involving medical records and claims data is drastically reducing competition, decreasing patient choice, and reducing quality of care.

Medical providers do not compete. Patients can’t get a second opinion anywhere. And if the patient has been misdiagnosed or experienced a medical error at any point in time, providers will not accurately diagnose the patient, leaving the patient with no treatment and creating chronic illness. Each doctor copies the last incorrect note, test result, or diagnosis. This occurs even if the patient is unsafe, even if the diagnosis contradicts reality. It is intentional. It is the culture.

Patients should hold the records in a central repository and have the ability to choose what to share with which providers and when. There should be incentives for providers to want to do better instead of maintaining the status quo.
 
It must be recognized that doctors often create chronic illness. CMS better find a way to fix this and keep patients safe. It is only getting worse as interoperability increases.">My comment pertains to PC-12 - barriers to competition.

My detailed comments are provided in the attached PDF document.

My response focuses on the real-world gaps between policy goals and the lived experience of patients and caregivers. Key recommendations include:

Mandating timely and complete data access for patients.
Improving the &quot;front door&quot; for health app innovation through a national API directory and reliable vendor sandboxes.
Establishing forward-thinking policies for patient-centric AI and a patient&#039;s fundamental right to capture their own health story.

I. Introduction: A Dual Perspective  
I submit these comments not in my professional capacity as a health IT executive, but as a 
citizen, a son, and a primary caregiver. My insights are drawn from my direct, recent, and 
often painful experience navigating our healthcare system.  
In early 2025, my 88 -year-old father entered the emergency room and never returned home. 
Over a period of less than two months, I was his advocate as he was moved from the ED, to 
inpatient hospital care, to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), back to the ED,  back to a SNF, and 
so on—a cycle of repeated transfers that culminated in a move to a nursing home and 
finally hospice, where he passed in mid -March. This journey, combined with my current 
role as the primary caregiver for my 84 -year-old mother with demen tia, has given me a 
stark, ground -level view of the gaps between this RFI&#039;s goals and the reality for American

•  CMS should ensure quality measures include patient refusal exclusions to avoid penalizing providers unfairly.
•  Measures for breast cancer, colon cancer, A1C, and BP control often lack standardized refusal handling across programs (e.g., MIPS vs. Star Ratings).
•  Repeated outreach to patients who decline care creates inefficient care loops, staff burnout, and verbal escalation toward nurses and MAs.
•  Providers face pressure from health plans, CDOs, and HEDIS teams to repeatedly “nag” patients despite refusals without clinical benefit.
•  Technology vendors (TD) must support structured refusal documentation (e.g., SNOMED CT codes) to enable fair measure exclusions.
•  CMS should address health IT ecosystem misalignment — providers (PR) are penalized while patients (PC) can refuse and vendors (TD) may not support refusal capture.
•  Remote monitoring data (e.g., BP cuffs, CGMs) should be integrated and measured appropriately, with patient opt-outs excluded from penalties.
•  CMS must ensure that value-based care models (VB) reward actual provider effort, not just patient behavior.">Protecting Providers from Penalties for Documented Patient Refusals in Quality Measures

1. There is absolutely no need to force digital ID requirements for any human being to access healthcare in globally.  Who comes up with these rules for everyone to group think.  There must be choices and options always.  If the powers that be wants to do this, then go ahead and let others be free will thinkers as God intended it to be.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever. (Agree).

3. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard. (Agree).

4. Everyone should have &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; meaning if Artificial Intelligence or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient, it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted. (Totally in agreement with Mr. Kane).

Thanks for your attention and consideration in this very important matter.

across chronic care management, annual wellness visits, transitional care, and more. After 
years on the front lines—watching care coordinators struggle with burnout, inefficiencies, and 
outdated systems—I founded CareCo, an AI-powered co-pilot designed to transform the way

1. Technology Vendors
Create a two‑tier “Certified Developer Access Track.”
Tier 1 opens a structured, developer‑ready HPMS plan‑benefit dataset; Tier 2 grants read‑only MARx/BEQ eligibility checks (dual status, LIS, SEP, current enrollment).

Stand‑up a CMS‑hosted Standardized Enrollment API. Certified platforms could submit, track, and correct applications directly—eliminating today’s costly, proprietary middleware and extending AOR transparency.

Adopt a plan‑developer co‑review model for content compliance. Plans and certified vendors jointly attest to benefit‐display accuracy; CMS spot‑audits instead of reviewing every screen.

Require open standards (FHIR, SMART on FHIR, OAuth/OIDC) across all new CMS APIs. This ensures one integration path rather than multiple proprietary feeds.

Public RFP disclosure with security pre‑screening (e.g., HITRUST/SOC 2). Publishing all tech‑related RFPs and allowing only pre‑qualified vendors to bid broadens competition while limiting noise.

2. Data Providers
Expand and enrich priority CMS APIs.
• BEQ API – add Medicaid level detail, SEP flags, human‑readable error codes; drop “plan‑sponsor only” restriction.
• Provider Directory API – require near‑real‑time updates, new‑patient status, wait times, languages, accessibility, network tier, C‑SNP/D‑SNP filters.
• Patient Access API – include encounter histories, prior auths, benefit accumulators; support caregiver delegation and multi‑payer cons... [truncated]">Summary of Recommendations from Circle Engage

As a multi-state virtual behavioral health provider serving primarily Medicaid beneficiaries, we welcome CMS&#039;s efforts to improve technology access and interoperability for Medicare. We strongly encourage CMS to extend these initiatives to Medicaid, where the need for modernization is even more urgent due to severe variation across states and managed care organizations (MCOs). 
--

STANDARDIZATION ACROSS STATES

Medicaid is administratively fragmented, with widely differing standards for credentialing, eligibility checks, and data access. CMS should: 

1. Establish a federal interoperability baseline for Medicaid programs.
2. Require uniform implementation of patient access APIs and provider data exchange standards across all Medicaid MCOs.
--

CREDENTIALING DELAYS

Credentialing with State Medicaid and MCOs continues to be one of the most significant obstacles for new provider groups:

1. Credentialing timelines routinely range from 3 to 12 months, with no standardization or transparency.
2. Duplicate submission requirements across MCOs within the same state add inefficiency.
3. Occasionally, the absence of retroactive billing during these long timelines leads to lost revenue and, more importantly, severe delays to care delivery.
4. Some MCOs do not accept tele-health only providers, restricting access to underserved regions.

Recommendations: 
1. CMS should require MCOs to comply with credentialing SLAs (e.g. 30-45 days).
2. Create a federal provider enrol... [truncated]">Ref: CMS-0042-NC

I am now starting to use PC-ACE, for billing for free directly to Medicare which seems fantastic although it has not been easy to use.  (set up, directions, support could be greatly improved please!).  I hope this direct billing to Medicare improves for small providers so many more small providers will not hesitate to provide services, increasing the number of providers to Medicare beneficiaries.

Keep that up!  We need similar support for the PC-ACE process.  Please improve the PC-ACE program for billing Medicare!

The United States healthcare system has reached the absolute limit of what a compliance-driven, market-led approach to interoperability can achieve. The persistent failures of the past decade the superficial adoption of standards, the entrenchment of data-hoarding business models, the stagnation of innovation, and the constrained potential of AI are not incidental bugs in the system. They are predictable features of a market that structurally rewards the creation of data silos. Continuing down this path with more incremental rules and voluntary frameworks will only yield more of the same frustrating results.

A fundamental strategic pivot is required.

Executive Summary
While we appreciate CMS and ASTP/ONC&#039;s efforts to advance digital health technology for Medicare beneficiaries, we respectfully submit that the current RFI framework represents a significant missed opportunity. By focusing primarily on Medicare beneficiaries, this initiative overlooks the fundamental principle that health is a lifelong journey requiring seamless care coordination across all ages, payers, and care settings.

In particular, the digital divide, now recognized as a super social determinant of health, risks exacerbating health disparities for certain populations. To bridge the digital divide for system-wide impact in health care, it is critical to address the digital divide in consumers’ capacity to adopt and use patient portals in their ongoing care management.  

Certain populations, such as aging individuals, commonly encounter barriers as a result of limited digital skills and physical accessibility issues. Psychosocial factors can also be barriers to learning such as “tech anxiety,” or fear of “breaking” something using technology, or “tech hesitancy” due to the uncertainty about the value and benefit of digital interventions in their lives. Unfamiliarity with portal features (like secure messaging and appointment scheduling) can reduce adoption rates further.

The digital divide in health care underscores the importance of delivering interventions that provide digital health navigation and critical digital literacy training and supports at the community level.

Zlenox welcomes CMS’s RFI CMS-0042-NC on interoperability. As creators of the Zlenox Healthcare Enterprise Resource Planner “ZHERP”—a cloud-native EHR/HRM/CRM for post-acute care—we offer policy perspectives to foster an open, collaborative ecosystem for both established vendors and emerging innovators.

Increasing competition in an EHR market dominated by a single company with over 75 percent market share is essential to ensuring that skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs) boost productivity through technological adoption. When one company controls the de facto system of record for SNFs, third-party innovators cannot introduce new solutions without full interoperability, covering both administrative and clinical data.

II. The Imperative for Competition

• Medicare Scale &amp; Value: In FY 2022, Medicare Part A payments to SNFs reached $27.2 billion across 15,000+ facilities. Ensuring those funds drive value, rather than entrenching static systems, is vital for cost-effective, high-quality care.

• Network-Effect Barriers: Developers target large user bases; facilities hesitate to switch without a mature app ecosystem. This cycle can stall innovations like decision-support modules, staffing alerts, or readmission analytics unless structural measures lower barriers.

• Data-Portability Friction: USCDI ensures a baseline export, but full record migration still relies on custom, vendor-specific extracts that must be transformed and manually reconciled. Combined with sta... [truncated]">I. Introduction

Healthcare Data Interoperability Policy Analysis – CMS-00420-NC
Page 1 of 36
HEALTHCARE DATA INTEROPERABILITY POLICY ANALYSIS
At Cognitive, we have witnessed the profound disconnect between the promise and reality of 
healthcare data interoperability, a gap that reflects not just technical challenges but also 
fundamental misalignments in how we approach healthcare transformation. Despite more than a 
decade of federal investment and regulatory mandates, the vision of seamless, patient-centered 
health information exchange remains frustratingly elusive, trapped between ambitious policy 
frameworks and the messy realities of healthcare delivery, where competing priorities, resource 
constraints, and entrenched workflows create implementation barriers that no amount of regulatory 
language can overcome.

Intellectual Property Issues with Assessment Scales 

One of the biggest issues with the data exchange of assessment scales is the intellectual property, meaning that every standards organization would need to get IP approval to share the questions and answers of an assessment scale.



SNOMED International wrote a document related to this entitled “Principles for managing Assessment Scales in SNOMED CT.”
As one can imagine, if an EHR vendor or healthcare application vendor obtains IP approval from every organization to do an assessment scale, that could be very expensive. 

One recommendation is that CMS could:
•	Negotiate blanket licenses for common tools (e.g., MoCA, Barthel Index, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Lawton IADL, COPD Assessment Test, Asthma Control Test, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, Autism Spectrum Quotient) across providers.
•	Require IP holders to publish digital, interoperable versions as a condition of endorsement.
•	Fund development of open-access alternatives to reduce dependency on restricted tools if licensing is prohibitive.
•	Include FHIR-compatible versions of assessment tools in standard rulemaking (e.g., QPP, MVPs).
•	Explore multi-stakeholder partnerships (tool owners, standards bodies, federal agencies) to create a licensed digital content clearinghouse.
•	Issue grants or contracts to buy rights for common tools, common assessment scales and faci... [truncated]">Extract from part 2 of my comments with ID: CMS-2025-0050-0254

Our comments focus on expanding interoperability, improving standards adoption, and enabling scalable data exchange for modern healthcare use cases.


Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) (PC-10, PR-6):
Newfire supports the continued adoption and advancement of TEFCA. We recommend that future regulations mandate the expansion of TEFCA (and require query responses by network participants) to use cases beyond treatment to enhance the usefulness of Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) for additional types of healthcare organizations, such as ISVs, with the consent of patients. This would require the implementation of advanced consent and identity management frameworks to make it easier for patients to consent to sharing their data with various parties and then easily manage that access, including restricting and revoking access at a later date.

Problem(s) overcome by this health management app:
Deciding whether to use a clinical intervention often requires weighing the expected 
benefits against the expected harms. Quantifying the expected benefits and harms 
requires finding and interpreting the evidence specific to the clinical intervention and the 
patient’s characteristics. Individualizing the determination of balance of effects requires 
knowing the patient’s relative importance of each benefit and harm. Despite 
instantaneous decision support for complex decision making in other environments 
(such as traffic navigation), there is no such common solution for healthcare decisions.

Executive Summary
Delfina’s mission is to transform pregnancy care by providing access to individualized insights and integrated systems that improve health outcomes. Delfina partners with managed Medicaid plans, provider organizations, and community-based healthcare practices to deliver our AI-powered maternal health technology platform. Our tech-enabled, closed-loop system of care helps healthcare providers identify patients who would benefit from early intervention, and then deploy evidence-based interventions and non-clinical support to the patient between clinical visits to help mitigate the risk for complications such as preeclampsia and preterm birth; leading drivers of maternal mortality and neonatal ICU (NICU) admissions. 
We fully support CMS&#039;s goals to promote interoperable, patient-centered technologies and urge CMS to explicitly prioritize maternal health use cases across its digital health modernization strategy.

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this Request for Information (RFI).   
 
I am the primary editor of the FHIR US Core Implementation Guide and have served as a subject -matter

front lines of care, helping my son through an urg ent appendectomy, assisting with a chronic condition 
that returned from remission, and calling 911 for an elderly family member after a hard fall.  
 
These experiences reaffirm the need to empower patients and families with digital tools that support

health ecosystem for the purpose of em powering Medicare beneficiaries  through

Given the goal is to unlock the power of modern technology for seniors and their famil ies I 
recommend keeping the focus  on patient access to data for sharing with providers  staying 
vigilant of provider burden.  
 
I suggest the following:

use it. My parents struggle with blood pressure de vices, phone apps , and numerous 
passwords  as they as traverse this modern age. Make the technology intuitive and

I sincerely applaud CMS for initiating this RFI regarding the health technology ecosystem. I submit these reflections to help guide CMS and ONC toward a future where digital tools are truly care-enabling.
1)	To truly advance quality and safety in healthcare, we must move beyond static, retrospective measures and instead incorporate the lived experiences of patients as active contributors to improvement. Current tools like HCAHPS, while valuable, offer a limited and often delayed view of care experiences, missing key dimensions such as emotional safety, real-time responsiveness, and other nuances of care that are necessary to really improve care. Patients are more than survey respondents - they are experts in how care feels and functions across settings. CMS should support infrastructure that enables continuous, bidirectional feedback loops - integrating patient stories, PROMs (Patient-Reported Outcome Measures), PREMs (Patient-Reported Experience Measures), and digital feedback channels into the core of quality measurement. Embedding patient voice will not only improve outcomes for all Americans, it will rebuild trust in care.

Policy recommendation:

•	Develop a mechanism to collect beneficiaries experiences and outcomes through multiple channels (online, phone/text, etc).  Such a mechanism is vital to u...

I submit these reflections to help guide CMS and ONC toward a future where digital tools are truly care-enabling.
To truly advance quality and safety in healthcare, we must move beyond static, retrospective measures and instead incorporate the lived experiences of patients as active contributors to improvement. Current tools like HCAHPS, while valuable, offer a limited and often delayed view of care experiences, missing key dimensions such as emotional safety, real-time responsiveness, and other nuances of care that are necessary to really improve care. Patients are more than survey respondents - they are experts in how care feels and functions across settings. CMS should support infrastructure that enables continuous, bidirectional feedback loops - integrating patient stories, PROMs (Patient-Reported Outcome Measures), PREMs (Patient-Reported Experience Measures), and digital feedback channels into the core of quality me...

Given the depth and breadth of my experience, coupled with the gravity of the chronic illness endemic and clinical provider shortage in the country, I strongly encourage the reviewers and Secretary to scale existing, proven AI-technology solutions and focus new innovation efforts into greenfield applications. Electronic Caregiver&#039;s Addison Care solution is a generative AI-powered conversational virtual caregiver which transforms the patient engagement and care adherence paradigm. 

This culturally-appropriate solution enables patients to select the race, gender, language, age, attire, holidays, and attire for their 24/7/365 caregiver - resulting in unmatched utilization and engagement. As a result, the significant health consequences of social isolation, loneliness, and depression are mitigated. Given the relationship developed, research has shown that the patients are more compliant and more honest in completing care surveys (Katz ADL Index, Johns Hopkins Falls Risk Assessment, SF12, etc.), measuring vitals, managing medications, and sharing status with human care coaches.

The recommendation addresses persistent gaps in care continuity, administrative burden, and digital access, particularly among older adults. It is grounded in over two decades of experience supporting provider workflows, patient navigation, and technology adoption within clinical settings.

The attached document outlines the proposed solution in detail, supported by current data on provider shortages, clinician burnout, and patient acceptance of AI in healthcare.

2. Data Access and Integration
c. What specific opportunities and challenges exist to improve accessibility, 
interoperability and integration of clinical data from different sources to enable 
more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence?
Integration of patient-centered clinical data traditionally has been a daunting, expensive 
and labor-intensive endeavor.  Accurate, reliable data is the foundation of every 
successful decision, strategy and operation in today’s business landscape. Entity 
resolution plays a crucial role in achieving high data quality by identifying records that 
refer to the same entity across different sources.
Without proper entity resolution, organizations face duplicated, fragmented and 
conflicting data, leading to costly errors, compliance risks and missed opportunities. By 
ensuring that all entity data is accurate, entity resolution enhances data quality, drives 
better insights and helps maintain the integrity of business processes, supporting 
informed and effective decision-making.

Summary of Recommendations

Improve Access to Second Opinions in Cancer Care
Launch a CMS demonstration program to support the development of a unified digital platform that enables patients to easily obtain second opinions. To encourage provider participation, the program should include reimbursement for digital pathology services and multidisciplinary tumor board reviews. The demonstration should assess the impact on diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, rural access, and patient outcomes.

I’m a 56 year old MD. I completed an NLM sponsored post doc in Medical 
Informatics at the Mass General Hospital Laboratory of Computer Science in 
2001, and thereafter I founded an EHR company, which I have been running for 24 
years. I have extensive knowledge of EHR, information technology, healthcare 
operations, and federal healthcare technology initiatives, including ONC goals, 
regulations, and certification requirements.  I’m an experienced coder as well. 
Before answering your questions below, I want to give a general perspective on 
my thoughts on the federal healthcare IT initiative.

The ONC had 2 main goals. One was to get everyone on EHR. The second to 
make everything “interoperable”. In the first goal, they have to some degree 
succeeded, although I think that the evolution to EHR would have anyway

As an independent health advocate, I assist families in navigating the healthcare system and ensuring their health needs are met wherever they go (school, work, home, community, etc.). Quite often the first step with a new client involves gathering medical records and creating a workable medical history. This can take weeks to months depending on the health provider/health system the patient utilizes. 

While most providers have electronic records, those electronic records do not always come with easy access for the patient or their caregiver. Many outpatient health providers do not connect their electronic records systems to larger hospital systems, forcing patients and caregivers to request information from multiple sources. Even more importantly, these records are incomplete, often not including lab results, surgical reports, or other detailed testing/treatment. Depending on the health provider/system and how their electronic records system is setup, the patient and caregiver might only have access to partial records, forcing them to request paper records in writing, incurring costs, and waiting for those to be mailed and received. Considering specialized services like labs and radiology centers, these results are often not electronically available to a patient at all.

There are few health-related applications that allow a patient or caregiver to connect their medical record portals, curate notes/history, or share that information with others. Primary Rec... [truncated]">RE: CMS-0042-NC

Dear Administrator Oz,

On behalf of ATA Action, we are pleased to offer the below comments in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS” or the “Agency”) request for information with the goal of removing unnecessary barriers to digital health access and promoting health care innovation.

ATA Action, the American Telemedicine Association’s affiliated trade association, is focused on ensuring all individuals have permanent access to digital health products and services across the care continuum. ATA Action supports the enactment of state and federal digital health coverage and appropriate payment policies to secure digital health access for all Americans, including those in rural and underserved communities. ATA Action recognizes that digital health products and services have the potential to truly transform the health care delivery system – by improving patient outcomes, enhancing safety and effectiveness of care, addressing health disparities, and reducing costs – if only allowed to flourish. 

We are excited to share with you that ATA Action acquired the Digital Therapeutics Alliance (DTA) on March 31, 2025. The DTA was the leading international nonprofit trade organization focused on expanding access to digital therapeutics. Through this acquisition, ATA Action expanded its advocacy efforts to support digital health tool...

•	Enhance the existing ecosystem to optimize the patient healthcare journey in conjunction with stakeholders, patients and caregivers 
•	Empower beneficiaries with better access to tools, personalized care navigation and information about treatments and cost so that beneficiaries can make informed, value-driven care decisions  
•	Reduce systemic barriers to care by expanding access in underserved populations and closing provider gaps in rural areas  
•	Utilize proven and emerging AI-based solutions to improve patient and caregiver experiences by leveraging data across multiple platforms to build a patient-centric experience 
•	Incentivize providers to optimize care with real-time, accurate and actionable data 
•	Aggressively modernize tools to quickly identify and mitigate fraud, waste and abuse through AI.

                                <td style="display: none;">CMS should seek to incentivize hospitals to adopt hybrid-virtual nursing models of care as a policy intervention to address nursing workforce issues, patient care quality, and as a mechanism to reduce hospital expenditures.</td>
                                <td style="display: none;">The comment strongly advocates for the adoption of hybrid-virtual nursing models, emphasizing their potential to improve patient care quality and operational efficiency, which aligns with support for digital health infrastructure. Additionally, it highlights the importance of interoperability in healthcare delivery, indicating a clear stance on supporting interoperability initiatives.</td>

ABOUT TYPE 1 DIABETES (T1D)
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can strike suddenly and, 
without proper management, can be life-threatening. It occurs when the immune 
system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to 
lifelong dependence on externally administered insulin. It is estimated that 9.5 
million people live today with T1D throughout the globe. A recent study estimated 
that nearly 2 million Americans currently live with T1D - nearly 600,000 enrolled in 
Medicare. 1
People with T1D rely on insulin therapy, delivered through multiple daily injections or 
insulin pumps to survive. However, insulin is not a cure as it is demanding and

General Comments  
In response to CMS’s RFI, I offer the following general comments:  
• Standards based Digital identity proofing and digital identity credentials ha ve the 
potential to ease the sharing of reliable health information by improving 
authentication and authorization processes for accessing electronic health 
information, supporting the reliability of identity as an attribute of the records that 
are exchanged,  and supporting the portability of digital identity across 
organizational boundaries and contexts.  
• The success of the Trusted Exchange Framework and Cooperative Agreement 
(TEFCA) is incomplete to date, and I believe confusion still exists about its future 
role as it expands into permitted purposes of exchange beyond treatment and 
individual access servi ces. As ASTP/ONC and the Recognized Coordinating Entity

In addition, clinicians are tasked with working in fast-paced environments while navigating outdated systems.

Today, various systems that clinicians use are often disconnected. These include electronic health records, laboratory and imaging systems, pharmacy and medication systems, admission, billing, and patient discharge platforms.

When providers are focused on screens instead of patients, the risk of error rises, leading to missed information, medication mistakes, and unnecessary or repeated tests. This leads to slower care, lower satisfaction, and compromised patient trust.

To improve outcomes, healthcare leaders must evolve past outdated systems and opt for solutions that allow for open interoperability. Interoperability refers to the seamless exchange and use of health data within hospital and healthcare systems, applications, and devices.

Weak points in medication management systems compromise patient safety. It is critical that clinicians have access to the right information at the right time to create proper treatment plans and deliver the highest level of care. Intelligent medication management software that connects and contextualizes information from different systems is a critical at the point of care.

Over the past decade I have helped nearly 70 health plans stand up CMS-mandated FHIR APIs, connected to 1000s of provider systems, and now deliver AI-driven analytics on 140 million patient records. That experience gives me a unique lens into the HIT regulations, standards, technology across the government, patients, clinicians, and payers.

Despite progress with Patient Access APIs, adoption remains low due to limited patient incentives. While health plans and providers are motivated to use this data to improve outcomes and reduce costs, two key issues prevent API standards from replacing traditional connectivity methods to improve outcomes: 

1. The full patient record is not sent via FHIR
2. Ease of access to data is still blocked by gatekeepers at EHRs and other platforms

1) The record that travels through FHIR is incomplete. USCDI and proposed Prior Auth standards like Da Vinci are insufficient to stand in for direct EHR access, FAX transmissions, and PDF exports. They cannot power prior-authorization automation, HEDIS gap closure, or risk-adjustment analytics. Much of the evidence behind those workflows—physician narratives, imaging summaries, operative reports—remains locked in PDFs or images. Worse, real-world implementations vary so widely that the same data element appear in different resources or extensions.

As the currently recommended APIs have a lot of flexibility and room for interpretation or different way to populate it especially for the same Resource in different Implementation Guides, it does not make for a standard implementation. It is very likely that we would have to construct a mapping for each different provider platform we connect to (not for each provider but to the EMR platform they use). This is unlike X12 or NCPDP transactions where we generally have one mapping and there are very little room for interpretation.

PA-3: Do not understand this enough to say that we would be able to use it. A question would be how to ensure that a digital identity is associated with the correct member we know. For example if we have 3 different John Browns, if a John Brown approaches us with a CLEAR login how do we  know to associate it correctly. Also if digital identities like this are used across multiple platf... [truncated]">It is good that CMA, ASTP/ONC and HHS are seeking input about Health Technology from each of the involved parties.

Thank you for the opportunity  to provide input on how e ffective and responsible adoption of technology 
can empower patients to make better decisions for their health and well -being.   Please find our views on 
how expanding access, specifically  to digital mental health tools (DMHTs ), offer s ways to support 
individuals in managing  their mental health ; supports clinicians in detecting, monitoring, and treating 
these conditions ; fills existing gaps in the behavioral health workforce ; and align s with the 
Administration ’s comprehensive strategy to make America healthy again.  
In this memo , we have also  included recommendations on actions the Administration could take with 
existing authorities to improve patient outcomes, reduce regulatory confusion, and increase the 
efficiency of the multi -agency response to the mental health crisis.  These recommendations stem from a 
multi -stakeholder process facilitated by Leavitt Partners. You can find more i... [truncated]">1

List of benefits:
1.	Semantic Alignment Across Agencies Without Schema Lock-in
•	Formal ontologies enable CMS, SSA, VA, and others to define domain-specific concepts independently while aligning on shared upper-level concepts (e.g., Person, Benefit, Encounter).
•	This supports semantic interoperability despite differing database schemas—key for TEFCA and whole-of-government data integration.
2.	Leverages NLM’s Trusted Expertise in Health Data Semantics
•	NLM’s stewardship of SNOMED CT, RxNorm, LOINC, and UMLS positions it well to coordinate federal formal ontology development.
•	A centralized branch (e.g., Health Data Standards Branch) could manage publishing, harmonization, version control, and API services.
3.	Supports Responsible AI and Large Language Model (LLM) Adoption
•	Ontologies provide AI systems with a ground-truth semantic layer that anchors predictions and conversational responses in well-defined concepts.
•	This enhances explainability, traceability, and trust, especially for CMS’s beneficiary-facing AI tools and decision support.
4.	Enables Smarter Interoperability in TEFCA and FHIR Exchange
•	Ontologies can support granular consent management (e.g., mental health, substance use disorder), data segmentation, and context-driven routing decisions.

Recommendation:
CMS should partner with NLM and ONC to lead a government-wide initiative to create formal 
ontologies for healthcare, benefits, and eligibility. These ontologies would define shared 
meaning across programs and agencies, enabling explainable AI, semantic interoperability, 
smarter FHIR exchange, and future policy simulation. This initiative would build on NLM’s 
work with SNOMED CT, LOINC, and UMLS, and create a standards-first foundation for 
TEFCA, LLM safety, and semantic reasoning — with future optional support for graph

On behalf of Big Health, we are pleased to submit these comments in response to the above-

Azuba Corporation respectfully submits this public comment in response to CMS-0042-NC, offering a production-ready platform that delivers multilingual communications, FHIR-driven interoperability, and real-time access to longitudinal clinical records. We support CMS’s bold vision to eliminate legacy burdens, expand digital access, and empower beneficiaries with co-equal participation in healthcare delivery and decision-making.

Azuba’s Health Communication Platform builds upon our enterprise-grade CCM solution, in use since 1986. It supports over 220 APIs and connects to 500+ EHRs, enabling real-time, standards-based access to clinical data for more than 100M CMS-covered lives and 260M+ individuals overall—including members across UnitedHealthcare, Elevance, and HCSC. Our workflows are multilingual (86 languages), compliant, and scalable, supporting tens of thousands of concurrent use cases and billions of transactions per year.

We propose the following CMS RFI-aligned recommendations:

PC-2, PC-9: Expand Blue Button 2.0 to support real-time FHIR access to clinical records, claims, ADT feeds, device data, and language metadata. Include endpoints for structured problem lists, immunizations, genomics, care plans, and prescription fills.

To accelerate innovation in digital health solutions for Medicare beneficiaries and caregivers, CMS should adopt a platform-centric strategy—one that not only supports individual developers but actively fosters the growth and participation of diverse platform vendors (including EHR-integrated platforms, cloud-based health APIs, patient engagement hubs, and AI-enabled coordination layers). By cultivating a policy and funding environment that encourages platform builders, CMS can amplify scalability, interoperability, and sustained developer interest.

1. Encourage All Forms of Platform Vendors
We strongly recommend that CMS and ASTP/ONC explicitly encourage participation from all types of platform vendors, including but not limited to:

API infrastructure providers enabling third-party developer access

EHR-embedded platforms offering native integration within provider workflows

Patient-facing engagement platforms that unify remote monitoring, medication adherence, and education

AI-based data orchestration platforms facilitating clinical insight generation from multimodal data

Regional data hubs or Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) that can evolve into patient- or provider-centric service platforms

By doing so, CMS can move beyond point-to-point solutions and towards ecosystem-level innovation.

2. Policy and Funding Recommendations
To stimulate this platform-centric direction, CMS may consider:

Examples of PolicyMap subscribers are the Veterans Health Administration, various city, county and state health departments, the FDIC, US Congress Joint Committee on Taxation, and FEMA among others.  PolicyMap saves time and resources otherwise spent on identifying data sources, cleaning / standardizing data, and keeping it up to date.  For example, in just a couple of clicks, find areas with higher concentration (available at census tract, zip, city, county, congressional district, state, metro area etc.) and combine with dental shortage areas, and overlay with locations of hospitals and federally qualified health centers, in a matter of seconds.  Upload your own program data to identify potential areas with gaps in services or determine impact of certain policy decisions.  In addition to viewing our data on the map, data is also downloadable or underlying data licensable for use within your internal systems and applications.

Despite growing interest in AI and interoperability, current industry maturity models, including those promoted by HIMSS, largely omit the foundational role of semantic infrastructure. Most models emphasize system adoption, data exchange formats, or analytics tools, but do not assess an organization&#039;s ability to represent policies, clinical logic, or program rules in machine-readable formats. Without formal ontologies and logic-based representations, even the most advanced AI models operate without grounding in the actual meanings of CMS eligibility criteria, consent structures, or care coordination frameworks. This gap undermines explainability, trustworthiness, and policy fidelity in AI deployments.
CMS, in coordination with ASTP/ONC, NLM, and possibly HIMSS, develop a Semantic Infrastructure Maturity Model that measures progression from siloed data to full ontological interoperability. This model would complement existing FHIR-based exchange and SNOMED CT usage by introducing a clear pathway for agencies, providers, and health IT vendors to adopt formal semantics. By embedding this semantic layer into TEFCA participation, AI-readiness evaluations, and policy simulations, CMS can lead the healthcare sector into a new phase of meaningful, computable interoperability, one where AI augments public programs with transparency and precision.

Since 2016, Public Health Innovators, LLC, has bridged digital inclusion and healthcare to ensure that all populations can benefit from digital health. 

CMS is uniquely positioned to ensure that digital health innovation benefits all patients through digitally inclusive efforts.  The National Digital Inclusion Alliance defines digital inclusion as “the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).”  These include: 

1)	affordable, robust broadband internet service; 
2)	internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 
3)	access to digital literacy training; 
4)	quality technical support; and 
5)	applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self- sufficiency, participation, and collaboration. 

The 2021 Digital Equity Act (DEA) identified “covered population” groups that face specific barriers to using the internet, including:

●	Rural residents lacking high-speed broadband;
●	Older adults with limited digital skills and heightened concerns about fraud;
●	People  with physical disabilities that hinder device use;
●	Individuals with language barriers;
●	Low-income households unable to afford devices or internet;

TransformCare proposes revolutionizing healthcare for 65 million Medicare beneficiaries by implementing AI-powered, patient-controlled health platforms that enable true free-market competition. Our response demonstrates how CMS can transition from price-setter to platform enabler by empowering patients with complete data ownership, transparent pricing, and genuine choice.
Key Innovation: Ontology-governed personal clinical knowledge graphs that transform fragmented health data into actionable intelligence, enabling patients to ask, &quot;What works for people like me?&quot; and receive AI-powered recommendations for providers, treatments, and care decisions.
Core Benefits: Eliminates information blocking, reduces administrative waste, enables value-based marketplace competition, and puts patients firmly in control of their healthcare journey. Our platform already connects 125,000+ clinical endpoints nationwide, demonstrating scalable real-world impact.
Bottom Line: While private insurers deploy advanced AI platforms, Medicare beneficiaries remain trapped in yesterday&#039;s fragmented system. CMS has an unprecedented opportunity to lead healthcare transformation by implementing patient-centered AI that creates sustainable competitive advantages through superior outcomes, transparent pricing, and exceptional patient experiences—the foundation of successful free-market healthcare.

Benefits of the collaborative agreement:
1. Improved Rare Disease Diagnosis and Management
•	Clinical Benefit: CMS could use Monarch&#039;s phenotype-genotype correlation tools to better support rare disease diagnosis, especially in underserved populations and rural hospitals.
•	Medicare Advantage: Risk adjustment models could include more accurate rare disease phenotypes using tools like PhenoTips or Exomiser that integrate Monarch’s ontology-backed data.
•	Pediatric and Disability Care: Enhanced models for children with complex medical conditions and adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities (IDDs).
2. Integration of Genomic and Phenotypic Data into EHRs and FHIR
•	ASTP/ONC Role: The Office could prioritize alignment with HL7 FHIR Genomics, GA4GH, and Monarch ontologies (HPO, Uberon, etc.) in USCDI+ Genomics.
•	Use in TEFCA: Federated phenotypic/genotypic search via QHINs could support undiagnosed disease networks and precision medicine pilots.
3. Enhancing NIH/NLM Resources like ClinVar, MedGen, and UMLS
•	NLM Role: Integration of Monarch’s cross-species phenotype ontologies into:
o	UMLS for semantic search.
o	ClinVar/MedGen for enhanced linking of phenotypes to genetic variants.
o	PubMed and PubMed Central search using phenotypic similarity.

As an FQHC-led Accountable Care and Management Services Organization supporting Medicare beneficiaries in 8 states and the District of Columbia, we see strong potential for digital tools—like appointment scheduling, medication tracking, and provider messaging—to improve care coordination, reduce burden, and empower patients.
Barriers to adoption include:
•	Limited digital literacy and lack of access to devices or broadband
•	Low interoperability across tools and EHR systems
•	A mismatch between tool functionality and patient/provider needs
We recommend CMS:
•	Provide financial incentives for FQHC-developer partnerships, ensuring that new digital tools address the real needs of underserved populations.
•	Tie incentives to interoperability with major EHR platforms (e.g., MyChart) to improve care management and reduce redundancy.
•	Fund broadband and device access programs for patients to bridge the digital divide, especially in rural communities where internet access is not readily available.
•	Establish certification pathways for digital tools optimized for safety-net providers, including multilingual and low-bandwidth features.
•	Support shared infrastructure (e.g., regional digital platforms or consortia) to make adoption more feasible for small FQHCs.

Introduction  
HealthyConnect.ai (a Remote Care Partners initiative) supports CMS’s vision of a patient -centric, digitally 
integrated health ecosystem. We believe every American should have access to a dynamic care plan, 
powered by AI, continuously updated through real -time data streams including EMR, HIE, pharmacy 
(Surescripts), and wearable integrations.  
We propose that CMS adopt the goal of enabling a Dynamic and Interactive Care Plan  as a national 
standard. Static care summaries or one -time instructions are insufficient for modern, complex care. A 
dynamic care plan, like that already used in HealthyConnect, is responsive, continuously updated, and 
serves as the foundation for better o utcomes, more meaningful caregiver coordination, and real -time 
decision support. This care plan should be visible to the patient, accessible to authorized caregivers, and 
integrated across providers and settings.

Drawing on over 30 years of experience in the Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) program, Combs-Dyer Consulting proposes modernizing data exchange infrastructure, expanding FHIR-based transactions, and refocusing policy levers to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse while also lowering provider burden.
Key Recommendations:
     •	Modernize Medicare Documentation Submission

Re: Docket  CMS -2025 -0050 
 
Executive Summary:  
The Radiological Society of North America ( RSNA ) applauds federal efforts to build a truly interoperable Health 
Technology Ecosystem. However, medical imaging remains insufficiently integrated into national data- sharing 
initiatives today. To close this critical gap, we urge CMS, ASTP/ONC, and HHS to take two targeted actions that 
will ensure every patient and provider can securely access imaging studies alongside other health data.  
• Mandate Imaging Standards in Certification: 
Require all certified Health IT products to support DICOMweb, HL7 FHIR Imaging profiles, and relevant 
IHE integration frameworks for patient - and provider -requested image retrieval.  
• Include Imaging in TEFCA QHIN Requirements:  
Expand the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement ( TEFCA)  Qualified Health 
Information Network (QHIN) framework to formally recognize and onboard imaging -capable QHINs, 
ensuring diagnostic images flow seamlessly across networks.

RE: Response to CMS Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem (CMS–6082–NC)

As a developer of digital diagnostic solutions, BioBeat Technologies is pleased to submit this response focused on the intersection of reimbursement policy, digital health access, and clinical workflow modernization.
Hypertension is one of the most prevalent and costly medical conditions in the US, with nearly half of all U.S. adults diagnosed with hypertension and annual costs estimated around $220 billion annually in 2019, per the CDC.  Three-quarters of people with hypertension do not have their blood pressure under control, leading to almost 700,000 deaths in 2022 in which hypertension was the primary or contributing cause of death.  Effective and highly cost-efficient options to diagnose and manage BP are available, including ABPM, but adoption is very low.  For instance, self-monitoring of blood pressure is estimated to save $7.50 to $20 for every $1 invested over 10 years, yet far fewer than 0.01% of people with hypertension use ABPM technology despite national coverage.  Streamlining access to ABPM services – and ensuring coverage of more convenient and manageable ABPM technology – can dramatically improve long-term Medicare costs and health outcomes

TD-4: How can CMS better encourage use of open, standards -based, publicly available 
APIs over proprietary APIs?  
Over the past decade, CMS has implemented programs and rules to promote the adoption of 
health information technology (IT), particularly through its leadership in driving electronic health record (EHR) adoption and interoperability. Initiatives such as the  Promoting 
Interoperability Programs (formerly known as Meaningful Use), as well as regulatory efforts like the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, have been pivotal. The 21st Century 
Cures Act Final Rule (enforced by ATSP and supported by CMS) built on the foundation of 
these programs and rules by requiring developers and payers to support standards -based APIs 
using HL7® FHIR®. These efforts marked a major policy shift toward patient access, data 
liquidity, and innovation through APIs.  
Building on the Cures Act,  CMS can help accelerate the maturation of data standards , not only 
through regulation, but also by supporting collaborative, public -private ef... [truncated]">©2025 Lantana Consulting Group. All rights reserved / www.lantanagroup.com

In my opinion, using FHIR for provider directories is not the best choice for this type of information. FHIR is for health information, but this data is identity/affiliation data. A simpler fit-for-purpose JSON document, per plan, would be easier to use.  Furthermore, there is no national index/list of these provider directories required by insurance plans and Medicaid plans. CMS/HHS/ASTP need to find a way to aggregate all of this information into one place so it is easy to answer the above common queries. An easy to use nationwide website for search and answering these question would also be helpful.  

It is also important to consider that &quot;providers&quot; are not the only actors in the health care ecosystem.  The US Health care system/HHS needs a directory registry that encompass other entity and object types (that do not have NPIs) including plans, APIs and other entity identifiers (OEIDs).">As for "provider directories", the most common queries of the public are:

incorporate DataOpus into their engineering processes to quickly and conﬁdently detect  
vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and data integrity issues  and provide courses of action to remedy them . 
Our knowledge of CMS and working with state health -based agencies were a leading reason why 
DataOpus was created.  In less than 2 -minutes DataOpus ; 
1. Produces actionable ﬁndings preventing the database portion of a healthcare system from 
being HIPAA compliant  (vulnerabilities, weaknesses, ﬂaws, data integrity  issues, etc.)  
2. Creates a data dictionary to help teams  with maintenance, interoperability, reports, AI, etc. 
3. Creates a code inventory to help with maintenance  and interoperability  
4. Measures &amp; Metrics

•Mesh Health Solutions,  
•Combs-Dyer Consulting, 
•Drummond Group, 
•Farseen Advisors, 
•Onyx Technology, 
•Tomorrow Health and 
•others.  
We wish to comment on the state of data interoperability and the broader health technology 
infrastructure as it relates to payers’ dual role of:
1)preventing improper payments, including fraud and abuse, and 
2) reducing providers’ administrative burden

RE: Request for Information; Health Technology Ecosystem

We commend the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ASTP/ONC) for addressing the state of data interoperability and broader health technology infrastructure. The release of this Request for Information (RFI) underscores CMS’s commitment to fostering collaboration with stakeholders to enhance healthcare delivery and outcomes.

Persistent disparities in health outcomes, particularly among historically underserved communities, are exacerbated by outdated and incomplete data collection practices1. The adoption of comprehensive and standardized data collection categories is crucial for enhancing data access, utilization, and community-driven interventions.

To improve interoperability and support equitable health outcomes, we urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its agencies, including CMS, to adopt and promote the 2024 revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (SPD 15) standards for the collection and use of race and

Executive Summary 

The Rising T1DE Alliance urges CMS and ASTP/ONC to extend patient access, interoperability, and certification requirements—currently applied to EHRs and certified health IT—to include medical device data platforms. These steps are essential to support data-driven, value-based care and empower Medicare beneficiaries with full control of their health information 
 

Key Recommendation: Medical device data portals should be subject to the same regulatory framework as EHRs and certified health IT systems, including FHIR API requirements, patient access standards, and interoperability mandates under the 21st Century Cures Act. This framework is essential for supporting data-driven care models and ensuring the long-term sustainability of value-based care initiatives.

This alignment allows for consistent semantic interpretation across systems, supporting more robust FHIR-based data exchange, clinical quality measurement, and public health reporting.
The ontology now in its v1.0 release as of March 2025 contains over 35,000 mapped concepts covering high-volume laboratory tests and physiological measurements (LOINC / SNOMED CT – Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and SNOMED International, n.d.). It offers implementers the flexibility to use LOINC, SNOMED CT, or the harmonized concepts based on their system’s needs, reducing duplication and ensuring semantic alignment. CMS should consider referencing this ontology in certification criteria, USCDI+, and quality programs to accelerate alignment with international terminology best practices and promote more meaningful use of structured data in real-world workflows.

The LOINC SNOMED CT extension (LOINC SNOMED ontology) will be very helpful for stakeholders. The LOINC model is different than the SNOMED CT concept model for various reasons and it’s wonderful to see the LOINC will be “SNOMED-ized” with the attributes, etc.

(Medicaid Health Technology and Ecosystem Modernization)

To Whom It May Concern at CMS and HHS,

Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment on this important initiative. I submit this both as a caregiver and health advocate, as well as someone with direct experience navigating the gaps in our current Medicaid system.

I am the mother of two adult dependents with cystic fibrosis—one of whom is a Medicaid recipient—and I have spent decades navigating complex systems of care, from hospital networks and specialty pharmacies to federal and state programs. In addition to my personal experience, I served as a national volunteer on the chronic illness and health reform team for the RFK Jr. presidential campaign, where I helped lead outreach to families facing complex care challenges and advocated for solutions rooted in prevention, food access, and caregiver support.

1. Recognize the Gray Zone Between Chronic Illness and Formal Disability

Many individuals on Medicaid live with serious, unpredictable chronic illnesses or serve as unpaid caregivers for those who do. These individuals often fall into a gray area—not officially disabled, but also not consistently employable due to flare-ups, hospitalizations, or caretaking demands. The current process to gain disability status is so complex that many must hire a lawyer—an impossible step for those already living on the financial edge.

Re: CMS-0042-NC-Request for Information; Health Technology  
Dear Dr. Oz:  
On behalf of the Partnership for Part D Access (the Partnership), thank you for the 
opportunity to respond to this information request. As you may know, the Partnership 
includes patient groups, advocacy organizations, and members of the private sector who 
work in coalition to ensure access to the full range of medications under Medicare Part D - 
particularly those under Medicare’s “six protected classes” (6PC) policy.    
Medicare’s 6PC policy requires Part D plans to cover “all or substantially all” drugs in each 
of the following six classes: immunosuppressants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, 
anticonvulsants, antineoplastics, and antiretrovirals. These six classes repres ent 
conditions where medication choice and access are critical to outcomes; drugs within 
these classes are not easily interchangeable. The 6PC policy protects patients, ensuring 
they can access the specific drug needed to treat their c... [truncated]">Dr. Mehmet Oz

A &quot;endpoint registry&quot; could be helpful in facilitating data exchange.  NPPES is not the right place for these endpoints.  Organizations often have many facility codes (NPI Type 2s) and many individual providers (NPI1s).  These electronic endpoints (of type FHIR, Direct, &amp; others) need to be published on the organization-level.  Endpoints should be bound at the EHR or organization level. For example the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) identifier &quot;dukehealth.org&quot; could be the primary key to lookup electronic endpoints for that organization.  This record would also tie together all related facilities (NPI2s) and individual providers (NPI1s), in a similar way to an FEIN.

Also individual providers are usually not the individuals responsible for updating NPPES or other organization/affiliation data records.  HHS must make it easy for organization-level staff and/or agents to manage published information on their behalf.  CMS/ASTP/HHS may consider using DNS to verify/ascertain organization-level identity.

Incentives: Outcome-Based Subsidies
•Technology investment incentives, such as a 15–20% SaaS cost reimbursement 
for platforms that demonstrate at least a 10% improvement in quality metrics or 
patient outcomes.
•Given the expiration of the APM bonus and the termination of several VBC 
models due to cost overruns, new incentives must be tightly linked to 
measurable, independently validated improvements in care quality and cost 
savings.
•Consider supplementing with time-limited regulatory relief (e.g., reduced MIPS 
reporting) for organizations piloting certified solutions.
Obstacles:
•Fragmented patient data and lack of interoperability between systems remain 
major obstacles, with many organizations reporting data mismatches and delays

At Aegis Ventures, we build companies that solve structural problems in healthcare. Our work focuses on care navigation, administrative simplification, and digital tools that work for patients and their caregivers. Through the Consortium, we co-develop solutions with health systems and patients, focusing on what works in real-world care delivery. We’ve built products that help patients manage chronic conditions, reduce unnecessary visits, and improve follow-through after hospital discharge—while addressing the operational barriers that slow adoption.

This gives us a close view into the gaps that patients, caregivers, and providers face every day. We understand the technical and policy infrastructure needed to scale digital tools across Medicare populations. And we understand what it takes to earn trust—among patients, providers, and caregivers alike.

The perspectives we share in this response reflect that vantage point. We welcome the opportunity to support CMS in building a digital ecosystem that works for everyone.">This response to CMS-0042-NC reflects the perspectives of Aegis Ventures and the Digital Consortium—an alliance of 11 leading, not-for-profit health systems across the United States—guided by the leadership of Dr. John Noseworthy, President and CEO Emeritus of Mayo Clinic.

Re: CMS -0042 -NC: Request for Information; Health Technology Ecosystem  
 
Dear Administrator Oz:  
 
On behalf of our coalition of patient groups, clinical societies, dialysis providers, and innovators, 
the Alliance for Home Dialysis (Alliance) thanks you for the opportunity to submit comments to 
the Request for Information (RFI) on the Health Technology Ecosystem. We agree that 
thoughtful and responsible use of technology can equip Medicare beneficiaries with the tools 
they need to make informed decisions about their own health.  
 
The Alliance ’s mission is rooted in patient choice and empowerment: to promote policies t hat 
facilitate treatment choices , with an emphasis on home dialysis , for individuals in need of 
dialysis and to address systemic barriers that limit access to the many benefits of home dialysis. 
We are grateful and fortunate to share that goal with both the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) and lawmakers in Congress.

In 2017, I addressed precisely the concern of this RFI, a health technology ecosystem, in an invited commentary for The BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) that was selected as an Editor&#039;s Choice because it laid out an important vision of the future. It drew positive comments both from eminent clinicians such as Dr. Tom Delbanco, who coined the term &quot;patient-centered;&quot; former JAMA editor Dr. George Lundberg; and technology visionary Dr. Eric Topol, in addition to patient activists and advocates.

In 2024, I updated that vision in an invited commentary for the blog of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. Its title was &quot;Artificial intelligence plus data democratization requires new health care framework.&quot; It is attached.

Let me be clear: the radical changes in the relationship between doctors and patients enabled by artificial intelligence cannot be addressed through handing stewardship to the traditional care system, big tech companies and some patient representatives thrown in for good measure. We need the kind of paradigm shift that the &quot;collaborative health&quot; framework I prop...

Today payment incentives strongly incent the consolidated delivery systems to block interoperability. They and their EHR vendors have a long history of preventing external interoperability though they support internal interoperability at vast scale. For political reasons these systems and their EHRs cannot totally refuse to interoperate so they engage in blocking tactics ranging from making mandated APIs difficult to access to claiming to support interoperability with platforms that do not support actual modern APIs. One current effort to prevent true interoperability while claiming to be interoperable is TEFCA. The Cures Act defines information blocking as limiting the access exchange and use of information. TEFCA is information blocking to prevent a modern digital health economy. TEFCAs brokers limit access, TEFCAs IHE protocols limit exchange and TEFCAs document payloads limit use. 
HHS should work on financial incentives for delivery systems to provide functioning APIs including enforcement of information blocking and antitrust laws. CMS should reset payment rates so that services which are digitally available are paid materially more. CMS should require changes in the CPT system to differentiate services with truly interoperable data from those which are not. Any service where the provider sees fit to share the detailed data ...

National Patient Advocate Foundation (NPAF) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments 
on this  RFI on behalf of the patients we serve.   
 
Background  
NPAF advocates for policies that are important to patients and caregivers in healthcare reform, 
including specific steps to preserve their financial and social stability alongside their medical 
and mental health in the context of coping with complex or chr onic conditions.  
For most patients and families, financial distress is a common consequence of illness.  This is 
true even for individuals with health insurance. Costs of medical and other care escalate fast 
and often overwhelm even the best planned household budgets.  Thi s hurts individuals’ 
economies, access, health , and quality of life. It also interferes with efficien t and quality care 
delivery across health systems and government -sponsored insurance and safety net programs.

One of the most helpful ways to see the value of AI in healthcare is to view the question through the lens of the “quadruple aim” 
framework. Built on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s “triple aim,” a widely accepted compass to optimize health sys tem 
performance, the quadruple aim focuses on four key areas where health systems need to be improved, across all of which AI is already

• Enhancing population health.

My name is Tomas Moran and I am a healthcare consultant.  I served as Senior Director of Quality and Planning at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF) through 2009, where I managed the entire analytic workspace.  During that time, I was a national speaker at the American Medical Group Association’s annual conferences and chaired the then-newly-formed Quality Council in 2008.  Prior to that, I served as Associate Director of Quality at Stanford University Health System (1989-1999), where I also wrote the software for and managed one of the first clinical lab computer systems (1979-1989) in the United States.  Most recently, my Company ran a Health Information Exchange in the Kansas City region through 2017.   And from 2017 through the present, we designed and installed a value-based payment system for the Jackson County Mental Health Fund.  
As a engineering graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1976, I brought much of that discipline into healthcare operation, particularly in the area of healthcare information and quality improvement methodologies.  During my career in healthcare – going into my fifth decade – I have seen the promise of empowering the patient and the provider with timely and complete information fall flat on its face many times.

Through these partnerships, measurable improvements have been observed in both caregiver well-being and care recipient outcomes. For example, digital interventions that include our brief, validated caregiver assessment (Caregiver Intensity Index) have achieved high completion rates (over 40% of caregivers getting their Intensity Score), with staff and clinicians reporting greater preparedness to address caregiving needs in clinical encounters. Additionally, caregivers using this tool report increased access to psychosocial support, which research shows is associated with improved mental health and reduced adverse outcomes for both caregivers and those they support.
There is an opportunity to share expertise on caregiver intensity and the strategies that have proven effective in diverse healthcare environments.

 US Healthcare Current State – Evidence Gap: 
 While healthcare data is now abundant, it remains siloed and difficult to transform into actionable 
 evidence. Today, only 14% of daily medical decisions are based on high-quality evidence—a disconnect 
 known as “The Evidence Gap.” Traditional clinical trials are limited and exclude nearly 70% of real-world 
 patients, including those with comorbidities, as well as underrepresented populations such as minorities, 
 children, and seniors, among others. 
 Generating high-quality insights typically takes months and significant resources, confining the process to 
 expensive, academic research settings.  The current system places significant strain on U.S. healthcare: 
 many patients do not receive evidence-based care, leading to avoidable adverse ... [truncated]">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

1) Digital health tools represent a new care modality. They should be treated on par with in‑person, telehealth, and remote monitoring services and supported by payment and quality frameworks accordingly.

2) Interoperability first. CMS should strengthen open HL7 FHIR (including Bulk FHIR) requirements, expand Blue Button to include clinical data, and mandate broad TEFCA participation supplemented by a nationwide FHIR endpoint directory.

3) Eliminate residual information blocking. Tighten exceptions, enforce penalties, and raise implementation testing standards so that complete, timely data exchange becomes routine.

4) Adopt federated digital identity. Universal acceptance of Login.gov‑level credentials will simplify access, improve patient matching, and reduce portal sprawl.

5) Reduce provider burden while advancing value‑based care. Allow CMS to calculate quality measures from Bulk FHIR exports, automate prior authorization via standard APIs, and modernize ONC certification to include care‑coordination and population‑health modules.

 General Observations  
Our organization  supports advancing patient access, data transparency, and system 
interoperability. We emphasize five core guiding principles:  
• Patient primacy and empowerment: Patients should have full access to their health 
data and control how it is used.  
• Comprehensive and performant data access: All data, including structured and 
unstructured, should be accessible and computable.  
• Open innovation and participation: systems should accommodate individual and 
organizational involvement.  
• Transparent and accountable networks with federal oversight: Networks such as 
TEFCA should be transparent, patient -centered, and federally governed.  
• Fostering competition through open and fair market foundations: Public 
infrastructure should lower barriers to entry and ensure equitable access.  
 
Patient Access  
PC-2: Easy Access to Health Information

information should be the gold standard.  Trying to manually reconcile data across 
multiple sources is frustrating and reduces the value of the data to the patient.  The

Interoperability  
Common sense would suggest that, as a patient, I should be able to access my health records from 
my phone or laptop with a few clicks of a button. My healthcare providers should be able to pull up 
my medical history and use it to inform their diagnosis or identify ways to prevent disease and 
chronic illnesses based on my family history. At the same time, this information should be secure 
and protected from bad actors. The reality for most Americans is that this isn’t their healthcare 
experience. Silos and l ack of access to information and services create an inefficient system that 
costs people money and ultimately results in inadequate health outcomes. There are two major 
areas that need operational, policy and IT modernization: electronic health records (EH R)

MHDC supports effective and responsible technology adoption that can empower patients to make better decisions for their health and well-being. Since most healthcare services are local, we believe that public-private partnerships and the inclusion of representatives from all local stakeholders, such as providers, payers, regulators, and system developers, are crucial to creating an innovative and competitive marketplace that facilitates health data exchange while also granting the autonomy local markets require to build innovative solutions. National level solutions, e.g., TEFCA, are not purpose-built for commerce, the driving force behind creating a health data economy.

We address in this RFI the foundations of a robust healthcare technology ecosystem, namely: 
• Consumers need a new and innovative digital health economy where transparent, high-fidelity, real-time data fuels the technology innovation required to achieve major advances in clinical and cost effectiveness. 
• Innovation is essential to achieve data liquidity and establish a new digital healthcare ecosystem. This ecosystem will utilize open standards to exchange health data at scale and provide patients with information when and where they need it. 
• Current regulations are not advancing the health data economy sufficiently. CMS and ASTP/ONC must prioritize commerce as the engine of innovation, aligning... [truncated]">We have attached our comment letter in full. Please see our general comments and key recommendations below.

To Whom It May Concern:

I respectfully submit our response to CMS&#039;s Request for Information (CMS-0042-NC) regarding the modernization of digital health integration and care coordination reimbursement.

This submission draws upon both lived caregiving experience and product leadership in regulated SaMD environments. It outlines actionable, subregulatory opportunities to strengthen the RTM framework in support of mental health self-management, chronic condition stabilization, and family caregiver enablement.

We believe CMS has a critical role to play in:
- Clarifying that CBT-informed behavioral coaching can be delivered through RTM without requiring a mental health diagnosis;
- Encouraging interoperability via TEFCA, FHIR, and Blue Button 2.0 to reduce provider burden;
- Defining RTM as a monitoring-not treatment-pathway to avoid unnecessary regulatory barriers for SaMD innovators;
- And ensuring caregivers are included in the reimbursement-supported care continuum through compliant dyad models.

KuduCare stands ready to support CMS&#039;s vision for scalable, cost-effective, and human-centered care. We welcome the opportunity to further contribute to pilot design or technical documentation, should that support CMS&#039;s implementation roadmap.

Resulting from lack of data sharing, the patient is often required to use multiple use case

apps, and doctor messaging and appointment management apps. As a patient or caregiver,  
it is difficult to get all needed health information in one place related to your personal readings and even more so for those that are helping to care for. Consider easy methods to

•	Licensed nurses
•	Medical assistants
•	Insurance verification specialists
•	Front desk staff

Phase 1: Strategic Planning &amp; Coalition Building
•	Build cross-functional team: health IT, clinicians, data scientists, terminology experts
•	Define scope: Start with one or two domains (e.g., lab review, imaging triage)
•	Identify partners:
o	EHR Vendors: Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH
o	Tech: Nvidia, Microsoft, Google Cloud, Red Hat
o	Standards Orgs: HL7, SNOMED Intl, openEHR
o	Terminology Tools: Ontoserver, Snowstorm
o	FHIR Hackathon Platforms: Firely, Inferno, Simplifier, Smile CDR
Phase 2: Baseline Data Collection
•	Analyze current in-basket loads
•	Identify top message types (e.g., labs, imaging, patient messages)
•	Document bottlenecks and duplications
•	Interview users (MDs, nurses, admin)
Phase 3: Launch Hackathon Tracks 
Hackathon tracks
•	SMART on FHIR apps to prioritize/route messages
•	SNOMED CT triage rules
•	openEHR bundled contexts- bundle message per episode using openEHR templates
•	NLP plus FHIR- use NLP to summarize or route inbound free-text messages
•	Governance and metrics: dashboards to monitor overload reduction

The current state of hospital care relies on manual, intermittent snapshots of vital sign information once every 4 - 6 hours by a healthcare workforce that is challenged by staffing shortages, which jeopardizes patient safety, and drives up the cost of care.  In the home setting, family caregivers are unreasonably burdened with the responsibility and cost of caring for loved ones yet have little means of recognizing the evolving complications associated with post-acute and/or chronic conditions.

In both settings, patient deterioration is commonly unrecognized until the patient “crashes,” triggering the rapid response team (RRT) in the hospital, or a call to 911 and an ambulance trip to the emergency room from home.  The inevitable consequences of this antiquated practice include transfers to the ICU, increased hospital mortality, increased hospital length of stay (LOS), increased healthcare workforce stress, burn-out, and labor expense, increased emergency room utilization, increased hospital readmissions, patient and family dissatisfaction, and skyrocketing increases in the total cost of healthcare to the US taxpayer and society.

Over the past century, our approach to “vital signs” has 
remained virtually unchanged – requiring labor-intensive manual 
collection, interrupting our patient’s rest, and yet missing signs 
of deterioration between collection times. “It’s too much, yet it’s 
not enough,” said Dr. Sarah Pletcher, vice president and 
executive medical director of strategic innovation at Houston 
Methodist.  
By adopting leading-edge sensors and wearable technologies, 
powered by clinical intelligence engines, Houston Methodist is 
poised to shift from a traditional episodic model of care to one 
that is more automated and continuous. This scalable approach 
to patient monitoring has the potential to: 
•  Streamline workflow  
•  Reduce hospital stays and costs
•  Empower clinical teams and patients 
  with highly actionable data
•  Personalize care and improve patient experience
Using these technologies will ensure leading quality hospital 
care despite workforce challenges, and to better support 
patient recovery at home. Up to $265 billion of care services

Given the poor state of health and well-being of Americans, MAHA is a precious call to action for the government, healthcare industry, and seniors to inspire and help each other get healthier - all of us together.

As leaders in the coaching industry (health and well-being coaching), we understand how people engage with healthy lifestyles, behavior change, digital tools, including EHRs, and the support they need to get healthier.

We are excited to propose upgrades, even transformation, of the healthcare tech ecosystem to bend the costs of healthcare downward, and help seniors get healthier, live their best lives, and model healthy aging for each other, their children and grandchildren. 

We have attached our submission and a supporting Lifestyle Medicine textbook chapter. Our submission accompanies the presentation we made to the CMMI prevention team on June 11.

Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem
June 16, 2025

We are submitting for the Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem on behalf of Violet Services, Inc. (Violet Health). We support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) efforts at increasing beneficiary access to effective digital capabilities needed to make informed health decisions, and increasing data availability for all stakeholders contributing to health outcomes. Our current healthcare data systems are deeply fractured, and we applaud the CMS and ASTP/ONC efforts to lead infrastructure progress.

PC-8., a. What data is valuable, but hard for patients and caregivers, or app developers and other technical vendors, to access for appropriate and valuable use (for example, claims data, clinical data, encounter notes, operative reports, appointment schedules, prices)?
At present moment, patients and caregivers have very limited access to provider skilling data–especially around the patient populations each provider is uniquely skilled at serving. When searching for a provider, it is difficult for patients to obtain accurate  data to understand which patient populations a provider has greater experience with and has completed a sizable amount of clinical education for. We are advocating for a standardized, unified benchmarking system to assess provider skilling in patient populations such as Rural communities and Veterans. This information w...

We’ve seen firsthand that when clinical data is exchanged efficiently, transparently, and in ways that respect provider workflows and payer goals, the result is better care, reduced administrative burden, and stronger financial outcomes. Yet today’s ecosystem remains fragmented. Not just in its infrastructure, but in its incentives. Even the most advanced solutions cannot succeed and thrive if the underlying incentives don’t demand, or even support, sustainable alignment.

To truly modernize healthcare, CMS must go beyond policy directives and technical standards and instead foster conditions that reward the exchange and use of high quality clinical data. That means shifting the focus from technical eligibility to measurable impact. Impact on care, collaboration, and cost. 

While not experts in all aspects of health tech, our perspective is grounded in experience. By securely connecting with more than 100 health systems, the largest national and regional US health plans, and third-party requestors across the country, Moxe’s technology-first approach is fundamentally changing the way clinical data is shared for Payment and Operations use cases.

Ecosystem RFI. We at TALON are eager to help CMS reduce the total cost of 
Medicare while maintaining or increasing the quality. Our detailed response 
to the RFI is attached to this document and includes our observations of 
Medicare and our ideas for improving it.   
 
This document discusses an immediately available solution that will save 
both the government and Medicare beneficiaries billions of dollars in 
aggregate and can be implemented quickly.  
 
Our primary recommendation is to implement a tool that enables Medicare 
beneficiaries to easily shop for healthcare based on cost, quality, and 
convenience. The shopping experience can (and should!) include an 
incentive to shop for the best value care... [truncated]">E M P O W E R I N G T H E F U T U R E O F H E A L T H C A R E

HealthTree Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2012, dedicated to empowering patients with complex diseases by helping them own their health data, contribute to research, and participate meaningfully in their care. Despite decades of regulatory progress—including the 2009 HITECH Act, the 2016 21st Century Cures Act, and the 2020 ONC Cures Act Final Rule—patient health data remains locked in fragmented silos across disparate systems and care settings. A maze of regulations (including HIPAA), misaligned incentives, limited data access, and the lack of patient involvement continue to stall progress toward lower costs and improved outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION/QUESTION: 3. Technical Standards and Certification
TD-11. As of January 1, 2024, many health IT developers with products certified through the ONC Health IT Certification Program are required to include the capability to perform an electronic health information export or “EHI export” for a single patient as well as for patient populations (45 CFR 170.315(b)(10)). Such health IT developers are also required to publicly describe the format of the EHI export. Notably, how EHI export was accomplished was left entirely to the health IT developer. Now that this capability has been in production for over a year, CMS and ASTP/ONC seek input on the following:
a. Should this capability be revised to specify standardized API requirements for EHI export? 

COMMENT: Yes. MCG Health technology experts agree this capability should be revised to specify standardized API requirements for EHI export.

The single most important proposal below is to re-envision HealthCare.gov as the universal patient front door. By redesigning and rebranding the existing website so beneficiaries can (1) discover vetted digital-health tools, (2) authenticate once with a trusted credential such as Login.gov, and (3) grant downstream apps seamless access to payer and provider data, CMS can address the awareness and trust hurdles that currently frustrate patients and caregivers, when it comes to utilizing digital health products. All other patient- or caregiver-facing improvements—price-shopping, appointment scheduling, intake-form automation, and real-time care navigation—depend on that foundational step.

CMS must treat imaging transparency as an urgent regulatory priority. It should no longer be 
acceptable for hospitals to control or manipulate diagnostic data to protect institutional interests at the expense of patient safety.  
PC-2(c): Were there particular data types (e.g., x -rays, test results) that were unavailable 
when needed for patient care?  
Yes. Diagnostic imaging studies (particularly full -resolution DICOM files from CT, MRI, 
angiography ) are withheld from patients and unaffiliated providers. Organi zations  block access 
by: 
• Refusing to share images digitally through patient portals.  
• Releasing compressed, non- diagnostic versions.  
• Issuing CDs rather than secure, electronic  downloads. 
• Providing different internal and external versions of studies, sometimes omitting views or series.  
These actions delay diagnosis, prevent timely second opinions, and obstruct specialist referrals. This practice is harmful to care quality, particularly for complex or progressive conditions.

Background  
Formularies a re Member Contract Documents  
As it exists in its full form, a formulary is a component of insurance policy that essentially functions as a 
contract addendum stipulating terms around coverage of drugs.  Formulary documents contain a 
number of kinds of information:  
- Explanatory text about how tiers, drug lists, and other terms of drug coverage work  
- Defines non -coverage of entire classes of drugs (e.g. hair loss, erectile dysfunction  etc.) in 
textual form  
- Provides contextual information about the scenarios in which drugs may or may not be covered 
often called the “clinical indication”  
- Defines specific requirem ents  around drugs that require prior authorization and/or step 
therapy.

ACLA is the national trade association representing leading laboratories that deliver essential diagnostic health information to patients and providers by advocating for policies that expand access to the highest quality clinical laboratory services, improve patient outcomes, and advance the next generation of personalized care.

The ACLA responds to several questions in this RFI (See attached ACLA Response to CMS-ASTP-ONC RFI on Health Technology Ecosystem). ACLA urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to carefully consider the role of the laboratory in the larger health interoperability ecosystem.  Laboratories are often heavily dependent upon upstream actors (e.g., an ordering clinician) to provide information to the laboratory in order to be an efficient part of the system. As such, requirements applied to laboratories may be difficult to meet if ordering providers are not obligated to provide the laboratory with the underlying information necessary to meet the request. For example, laboratories may not have sufficient patient demographic information to fulfill other downstream obligations, such as public health reporting or direct patient communication of results.  To ensure that CMS obtains the efficiency it seeks when making changes to interoperability requirements, CMS should be careful in applying a...

A barrier to adoption of TEFCA is due to the lack of incentives or clarity on what data that payers are expected to reciprocate in order to join TEFCA. An additional barrier is the ambiguity surrounding the total cost of implementation for Healthcare Ops exchange purposes (XPs) are hindering adoption as well as the lack of clarity regarding details of claims data reciprocity and the lack of clarity regarding participants’ ability to charge for Healthcare Ops XPs.

Executive Summary
GetSetUp is a digital-health learning platform dedicated to eliminating digital-literacy barriers for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Partnering with state HHS agencies, value-based-care organizations, MCOs, D-SNPs, caregivers, and payers, we have delivered more than 14 million live and on-demand sessions across 32 states over the past five years, boosting telehealth adoption, care navigation, and benefits literacy. 
Drawing on this experience, we urge CMS to create a “Digital Engagement Pathway” certification and to pilot reimbursement for evidence-based digital-literacy platforms beginning in PY 2026, so that equitable, outcome-driven digital-health engagement can scale nationwide.

This response is intended to supplement our joint submission with Availity to CMS’s Request for Information; 
National Directory of Healthcare Providers &amp; Services (CMS -0058 -NC), submitted in December 2022.  
 
Question TD- 5 
How could a nationwide provider directory of FHIR endpoints improve access to health information for 
patients, providers, and payers? Who should publish such a directory, and should users bear a cost?  
 Answer TD- 5 
A nationwide provider directory with FHIR endpoints would establish a foundational infrastructure to 
transform healthcare access by creating a unified source of truth for provider data across the entire 
ecosystem. This directory would serve as the critical  matching platform connecting patients&#039; care needs to 
capable and available providers, while eliminating the pervasive &quot;ghost network&quot; problem that undermines

CMS, ASTP/ONC and NLM could endorse the standards and interoperability scholars program. This program makes masters and PhD students co-creators of national health data infrastructure, rather than waiting to “earn” that access years later. It addresses the pipeline problem, the innovation gap, and the mentorship shortfall — while directly fueling progress on interoperability, terminology, and real-world implementation.
For masters and doctoral students in:
•	Health informatics/biomedical informatics
•	Computer Science
•	Data Science
•	Public Health
•	Medicine
•	Nursing
•	Health Policy or Law

Core Components:
1.	Applied Research and Implementation Labs
Participants are matched with real world challenges, such as:
•	TEFCA semantic alignment (such as USCDI+ vs existing data flows)
•	SNOMED CT concept gaps in behavioral health or maternal health
•	FHIR IG usability studies for underserved providers
Deliverables would be research to publish, policy briefs, implementable artifacts
This work can fulfill masters internship/practicum requirements or masters thesis.
This work can fulfill PhD preceptor, research and/or dissertation requirements.

Request for Information: CMS-0042-NC Health Technology Ecosystem 

Dear Administrator Dr. Oz: 

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to CMS’s Request for Information (RFI) on CMS-0042-NC “Health Technology Ecosystem”. As the Clinical Director at the Direct Supply Innovation &amp; Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and a dedicated partner within the senior healthcare sector, I fully support CMS&#039;s objective of leveraging digital health solutions to enhance patient care, streamline processes, and reduce redundancies. Technological advancements, particularly interoperability and artificial intelligence, offer significant potential to enhance outcomes, reduce administrative burdens, and improve efficiencies across the senior care continuum.  

Approximately 1.4 million Medicare beneficiaries receive care and live in nursing homes across the U.S. Given unprecedented demographic shifts, the population of older adults is projected to reach approximately 95 million individuals by 2060. Simultaneously, the workforce is not expanding proportionally. Census data indicates the ratio of workforce aged individuals to those over the age of 85 will shift from 31:1 today, to 12:1 by 2060. Demand for caregivers will far outpace the supply. 
Therefore, it is imperative to modernize nursing home regulations and align funding and incentives to support technology adoption, interoperability, and sustained utilization in support of workflow efficiencies, augmentation of the wor... [truncated]">June 16, 2025

collective efforts of numerous patient advocacy organizations, such as Patients for

PA-2. How can CMS encourage payers to accelerate the implementation and utilization of APIs for patients, providers, and other payers, similar to the Blue Button 2.0 and Data at the Point of Care APIs released by CMS?

There is opportunity to make API integration more accessible by suppliers and Issuers. Currently, filing work yields significantly more manual labor than should be warranted when working in systems such as the Health Insurance Oversight System (HIOS), Rates and Benefits Information System (RBIS), System for Electronic Rates and Form Filings (SERFF), and all other subsequent modules.

My overall message to HHS is that this entire exercise will be a waste of breath and energy unless you ENFORCE regulations.  

Hospitals have strong commercial incentives not to make it easy for patients to take their business elsewhere, so it’s no surprise that hospitals do not commonly make it easy to download your case information and go elsewhere. (By far the greatest attention I’ve ever had on LinkedIn was when I did exactly that - downloaded my data and took my business elsewhere. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/epatientdave_patientautonomy-medicalrecords-patientcentric-activity-7026611151106908160-eaXr/ )

A related issue is that interop requires real work, so managers who are under financial pressure are motivated to resist doing that work. I understand this. But &quot;It&#039;s too haaarrrrd&quot; is not a morally acceptable reason to hold back on improving people&#039;s health.

I. Prioritize Enforcement through the National Provider Directory

To achieve true interoperability, we must go beyond enablement and prioritize enforcement. The National Provider Directory (NPD) is essential to this. A verified, centralized listing of FHIR API endpoints will make compliance auditable. Without it, we have no technical or policy mechanism to ensure providers meet existing mandates. At the June 3 ONC/ASTP Listening Session, I emphasized that enforcement is the true incentive. If a provider cannot be digitally reached, the system fails. CMS must treat the NPD not as infrastructure, but as accountability infrastructure.

II. Empower Consumers with Full EHI Access and Patient-Facing APIs

Patients are the only consistent node across fragmented systems. I’ve spent years manually collecting my children’s records from different hospitals, only to find that I still don’t have their full longitudinal history. We need functional, enforceable APIs that suppo...

 TD–16. What are the tradeoffs of maintaining point-to-point models vs. shared network infrastructure? 
 a. Do current rules encourage scalable network participation? 
 b. What changes would improve alignment (for example, API unification, reciprocal access)? 
 Current rules do encourage scalable network participation, though our experience with payer 
 customers grappling with the real-world challenges of reducing the burden of the prior authorization 
 process on patients and providers we see additional opportunities for improvement. 
 Specifically, we must improve the identification of both providers and payers– leveraging the 
 capabilities of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity protocol to better refine our understanding of the 
 organizations involved in healthcare decision making and payment– while at the same time, further 
 enhancing data protections. It would be helpful to have a better mechanism for reflecting the

▪McKinsey is a “power user” of CMS data – we hold 25+ seats within the Virtual Resource Data Center 
(VRDC), have licensed limited data set (LDS) and qualified entity (QE) files, and regularly ingest publicly 
available CMS files (e.g., Medicare Advantage enrollment and plan data)
▪Our experience building data products from CMS claims files – e.g., a deduplicated claims dataset for Dual 
Eligible beneficiaries – gives us a broad knowledge of data quality issues and potential 
improvements  CMS could pursue
▪We have deep expertise standardizing and interpreting data , rooted in a proprietary data model and 
data enrichments used for both CMS -provided and other datasets (e.g., commercial claims data, EHR 
data) licensed from third parties
▪We understand the needs of a diverse set of healthcare entities , given our experience building tools

investment stocks is a process that is backed by research of the business, market conditions, and price 
levels, and it accommodates any and all client&#039;s preferences and restrictions.  Although historical

Dear Administrator Oz:  
 The ASTP/ONC collaboration with the American Board of Family Medicine (“ABFM”)
1 
found that only 8% of family physicians reported that information obtained from 
organizations that use different EHR developers’ products than their own was very 
easy to use.2 In contrast, 38% reported that information obtained from organizations 
that use the same EHR developer’s product was very easy to use.2 At the point of care, 
family physicians reported that the electronic transfer of medication data from 
outside organizations, the ability to find it, and the ability to use it to reconcile 
differences was only possible 13% of the time.3 This is not safe for patients and 
creates tremendous burden for clinicians.

On behalf of CommonWell Health Alliance, we are pleased to submit comments on CMS and 
ASTP/ONCs Request for Information; Health Technology Ecosystem published on May 16th,

CommonWell Health Alliance is a not -for-profit trade association that includes a variety  of 
health IT and health care stakeholders. We work on interoperability across technology 
companies, payers, agencies, providers, clearing houses, patients,  and more. Since our launch in 
2013 with services focused on Care Treatment, we have enabled other use cases including 
Individual Access and look forward to furthering  adoption and expansion of existing and future 
use cases.  
Our vision is simple: health data should be available to individuals and caregivers wherever care 
occurs, at a reasonable cost. CommonWell, with our service provider and members, has created 
a vendor -neutral platform to remove barriers to effective health data exchange. We leverage

HHS published a report 6 years ago which found 88% of Americans have low health literacy. This negatively impacts quality of life and health outcomes. We have more data but we don&#039;t know what to do with it.

While the trusted relationship between doctor and patient is sacred, there are opportunities for technology to alleviate existing pain points. There is better health data transparency with the passing of the Information Blocking, however,  patients often receive results before their care team has reviewed. To try to understand results before the conversation with their physician, patients may instead go to resources that are not evidenced-based. 

Instead, we should be doing more with the data to help patients and their care giver /loved ones facilitate higher impact conversations with their clinical team.

What health management or care navigation apps would help you understand and manage your (or your loved ones) health needs, as well as the actions you should take?

There are few clear, simple ways to understand available Medicare benefits, nor guidance on how certain benefits may improve outcomes rather than cycling through more expensive benefits (for example SNF utilization vs home health utilization). 

When Medicare benefits are difficult to understand, usage is driven by emergency, ignorance, lack of support and guidance, rather than preventative interventions which could reduce hospitalization and other significant health costs. 
When caregivers are included in access to Medicare benefits information, they can help Medicare beneficiaries access lower-cost benefits and prevent high-cost future interventions. 

This also applies to providers. Providers can benefit from not only access to patient data, but also direction on use of Medicare benefits to reduce costs. For example, understanding eligibility requirements for home health, tied to correct timing of a home health intervention, could significantly reduce utilization volume and cost while managing disease and outcomes, especially for chronic complex patients. 

RubyWell’s data models are designed to do just this - interpret patient data - both self-reported, claims, and EHR data - to predict the need for home health as a cost-reduction strategy, and to guide physicians in making these referrals, taking into c...

RubyWell is committed to engaging family members, training them as Medicare-certified healthworkers, and placing them at the center of the Medicare beneficiary’s care team.  This, coupled with our technology, is intended to significantly reduce 90-day hospital readmission rates and drive decline in emergency room usage. 

Effective use of data to tell a useful story that caregivers can use to guide care, contextualizing available benefits in the context of care at home, and predicting the timely intervention for home health services can reduce Medicare spend by 25-59% on medically comparable patients. Families and providers use our tools to make care-based decisions that are best for their loved ones and that reduce overall Medicare spend. 

Central to our offering is the combination of data that tells a story AND access to training and paid work - engaging caregivers as healthworkers, in a professionalized environment with appropriate supervision and care plan guidance, is central to improving outcomes, addressing the care crisis, and building capability for care in the home.

What can CMS and its partners do to encourage providers, including those in rural areas, to leverage approved (see description in PC-5) digital health products for their patients?

It is critical to meet users where they are, especially those in rural areas, or with poor online access. RubyWell’s technology centers on voice enablement, increased real-time interaction with existing hardware solutions, surveys and questionnaires completed online or in dialogue with support (by phone), and peer-to-peer community-building. Data that RubyWell collects, analyses, and interprets is available to users via a secure portal.

In addition to voice enablement technology, we believe that leaning into simple, existing technologies - for example, texting, since messages can be sent with very little connectivity - are central to good communication between care teams and families.  

All that said, the most important pathway to adoption is aligned incentives with the needs of the providers in remote areas. Solutions should address their pain points - reaching far-flung patients, communicating with care teams in real time while they are scattered over a large geographic area, low-connectivity solutions - and they should be rewarded for tech adoption that improves outcomes and creates efficiencies.">PR-1.

Executive Summary  
Adherium is an FDA -cleared digital health company focused on improving medication adherence 
and respiratory care management through remote monitoring and connected inhaler technology. 
Our Hailie® SmartInhaler®  platform integrates directly into clinical workflows and collects 
physiologic and usage data that enables timely, proactive care.  
From our experience deploying real- world remote monitoring  programs with large provider 
networks, we believe that CMS and ONC have laid a critical foundation for a patient -centered 
digital health ecosystem. However, to make digital health truly scalable for Medicare beneficiaries, 
several infrastructure gaps must be addressed , particularly around pharmacy data access, 
interoperability standards for device data, and certification criteria that support modular, open platforms.

Our Recommendation to CMS
Mandate and incentivize open, standards-based APIs to provide comprehensive, real-time access to all permissible structured, semi-structured, and unstructured patient data across the healthcare continuum. Data is the fuel that powers modern information technology. Aligning all participants to transmit and receive clean, accurate data will ensure that the patient and member can feel confident that their experience with healthcare is accurate, personalized, and dependable—regardless of which part of the ecosystem they engage with to seek the care or clarity they need. Establishing a solid foundation of data for all parties will allow stakeholders to adopt value-based care models more effectively and quantifiably. This alignment will also facilitate the optimization or elimination of administrative processes, expedite the integration of advanced digital health and healthcare technology solutions, and enhance the quality of care for patients and members within the US healthcare system.

Introduction  
The 21st  Century Cures Act (P .L. 114- 146)  speciﬁe s that:  
The Secretary shall use existing authorities [...] with the goal of offering patients 
access to their electronic health information in a single, longitudinal format that is easy to understand, secure, and may be updated automatically.  
This response to the HHS Request for Information on the health technlogy  ecosystem is 
focused on accelerating patient adoption of “ electronic health information in a single, 
longitudinal format ” as called for by the Act. In this note, we use the term “lifetime medical 
record” to refer to this concept . 
The content is organized into three sections : 
• Vision. The vision of how  patients can  access and control their  lifetime  medical 
record  using an online service provider of their choice.  
• Detailed Scenarios . Decomposition of the vision into the key process ﬂows which 
together can implement the vision.

This proposal represents significant betrayal of Robert F Kennedy MAHA and health freedom voters. Many objectives as presented are pointing in the wrong direction. CMS and HHS should go back to the drawing board. 

Our voters are very picky in their choices of applications they may use. They place extra value on individual health choice and control of their data. Attempts on one-size-fits-all solutions wouldn’t work for our people, whether VBC models or single PHI data location. 

PC-1a. 
This objective is undesirable. Patients PHI should not be exchanged without explicit patients consent. Everyone should be able to know everyone who may have access to my PHI. I would like to be able to ascertain that control, which is now missing. To that event, every entity in possession of PHI must be required to report to the person whose data it is their status on an annual basis. A patient should have ability to withdraw consent and assured deletion of such records. 

PC-2. 
There is little to no value of having all my PHI data in a single online location. I would like to be able to download all data about myself on a USB and share it with other providers in a way that ensures my control. 

PC-4. 
Pricing information is currently missing or is hard to obtain. If would also be helpful for HHS to facilitate a provider review and rating system, similar to yelp or healthgrades. The benefit of such USG service would be in s... [truncated]">Comment on RFI CMS-0042-NC

Clinical data (including diagnosis and prescriptions), encounter data and appointment schedules from health systems and PCPs are incredibly difficult to access in a timely fashion. HIE integration takes over 3 months and are constrained by the engineering capacity of the HIE providers, making it hard for startups to move quickly. The current process to get latest diagnoses and medication lists from a patient’s care team involves faxing back and forth multiple HIPAA release forms, calling to request efaxing of lists, following up when faxing falls through the crack (unreliable means of communication), emailing physicians to confirm whether the medication list and lab results are up to date.

Also would be valuable to have pricing data of non-clinical providers, which often takes up a bigger share of a Medicare patient’s care cost. For example, right now it takes ~20 calls to find an affordable home care provider for a patient because pricing isn’t transparent.


HIE

HIE integration timelines are long (12+weeks) and are constrained by the engineering team capacity of the HIE providers.  We would recommend turning it into an open API endpoint that allows technology developers to integrate with in a self-service way (with HIPAA compliance guardrail).

I believe in the ﬁrst principle of medical ethics, the right to informed consent with the right of the patient to accept or refuse any treatment. This applies to being at the doctor’s ofﬁce or in the hospital.  I believe that there should be an amendment to the U. S. Constitution with these rights. These healthcare rights are human rights for all. A doctor’s time with a patient should be spent with the doctor looking at, talking with and examining the patient, not looking at a computer screen and ﬁlling out forms. There should be no such thing as “prior approval” or authorization. If a patient’s doctor recommends something, that is ﬁnal. I believe laws should be passed that do not allow hospitals to have incentives to kill patients as they did during Covid, and they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Public Comment on CMS-2025-0050-0031:  Health Technology Ecosystem RFI Submitted by:  F|42 (www.f42.co)   Introduction More than 100 leaders from across healthcare have come together to build F|42 to define, advocate for and enable a person-centered healthcare system. Based on both research and our collective experience, we believe that person-centeredness can drive better human, clinical and financial performance in healthcare.  Doing so requires taking a holistic approach that is centered on the wants and needs of the individual – something that is beyond the scope, capabilities and experience of individual organizations. Consequently, we are built as a 501(c)3 to serve as an honest broker and to facilitate the ecosystems necessary to holistically support individuals and their needs.  Our response to the RFI is specifically focused on the specific Patients and Caregivers (PC) questions that speak to the need – and opportunity - for greater person-centeredness in healthcare.

I would like to manage my health records with an app that would allow me to store all of my records in a decentralized system so that I can access all of my records through a secure software or hardware wallet and grant or deny access to any part of my records by providers, payers, researchers, and public health authorities. I would like it to give me the ability to withdraw previously granted access to all or part of my records at any time. I would like the process of granting and withdrawing access to be seamlessly integrated with provider EHRs, so that when I grant access to all or part of my records, they will be accessible through the provider’s EHR. I would also like to be able to delete my records that have been stored in the decentralized cloud. 

I would like the ability to select data sets from my health records by type and application. For example, I would like to be able to select and share all data relevant to cancer screening or cardiovascular health but select and exclude or delete all social determinants of health data in my records. I would like to be able to grant providers the ability to upload data such as notes, test results, diagnoses, prescriptions, etc. to my health records but only access them if I grant access via my digital wallet.

For me, apps that would be useful are those that would note health problems (not just collect lots of data) by analyzing information and providing a notification to take a specific action, go to a specific provider, or send a notice to my doctor.  The app need to recognize important data and where to get it, not me.  For example, getting my &quot;Blue Button 2&quot; data does not provide me much guidance on what needs to be done.  Providers or care teams should get the alerts.

PC-5

CMS should be working with data vendors by publishing use cases and functions that a good digital health product should have, then allow the vendors to submit that app for some sort of certfication that it meets specific use cases.  The vendors can then advertise that their app takes care of the use cases.  CMS could publish the use cases and list apps that meet them.  This would allow patients to select the apps that are most appropriate for them, their caregivers, and their providers.

PC-12

Most of the examples given are for basic adminstrative functions, which are nice but not necessarily very different or valuable.  Apps should handle use cases for specific diseases, provide patient and or provider alerts for significant issues, and assist patients with their individual care plans (pill reminders, therapy exercises, individual diet suggestions.)">PC-1

Submitted by: Kristy Shell, RN, BCPA
Founder, Haven Healthcare Advocates

As a registered nurse, board-certified patient advocate, and professional care manager with over 20 years of experience, I work directly with individuals and families to help them understand their healthcare and navigate a fragmented system. Despite the original promise that electronic health records (EHRs) would make healthcare more cohesive, organized, and efficient, the current reality is far from that vision.

Health technology—particularly EHR systems—needs to better support the coordination of care across providers, systems, and geographies. I respectfully submit the following concerns and recommendations based on my experience in clinical and advocacy roles:

Lack of Interoperability:
Patients’ health information is routinely scattered across multiple portals tied to different health systems. These portals do not communicate with one another, which creates silos that hinder providers from seeing the full picture. This fragmentation often leads to delays in care, duplicated testing, and increased risk of medical error.

Barriers to Caregiver Access:
Family caregivers and professional advocates frequently encounter challenges accessing patient portals. Even when patients willingly share log-in credentials—something they should not have to do—dual authentication and security barriers make consistent access difficult or impossible. A more flex...

Our founding team, an emergency-room physician, a special-needs caregiver, and a former critical-care nurse (me), has spent the past ﬁve years living the caregiver side of “interoperability” inside todayʼs health technology ecosystem. The 21st Century Cures Act opened a historic door: patients are no longer spectators, but rightful stewards of their electronic health data.

This response highlights Advance Care Planning (ACP) as a critical, underutilized strategy that advances both goals.  Advance Care Planning: A High-Impact, Patient-Centered Use Case When patients lose the ability to make or communicate their own healthcare decisions, the absence of clear, well-documented preferences can cause significant harm. Families are often left to make agonizing decisions in moments of crisis, which has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD among surrogates (Wendler &amp; Rid, Ann Intern Med, 2011).

This dynamic contributes to moral distress among clinicians (Epstein et al., J Gen Intern Med, 2019), emotional trauma for loved ones, and care expe...

Re: Health Technology Ecosystem | Submitted by emocha Mobile Health, dba Scene Health

CMS spends billions of dollars each year on medications that never fulfill their clinical promise. Net spending, after rebates, on Medicaid prescription drugs rose to $43.8 billion in 2022, an increase largely attributed to high-cost specialty drugs. Medicare Part D spends ~$180 billion on gross drug spending, while Part B costs tens of billions for provider-administered drugs. This is not because these medications are ineffective, but rather because they are not taken – or not taken properly. The issue of medication adherence is not a fringe problem; it is the most fundamental, preventable failure in our healthcare system.

At least 50% of patients with chronic diseases don’t take their medication properly, which leads to exorbitant, avoidable costs and waste, in addition to widespread pain and suffering. As Surgeon General Koop stated in the 1980s, “Drugs don’t work in people who don’t take them.” A 2018 study put the annual cost of medication nonadherence in the U.S. at more than $528 billion. Moreover, nonadherence is responsible for over ~125,000 preventable deaths and up to 25% of hospitalizations each year.

Introduction  
Innovation thrives when leaders like CMS  and ASTP/ONC  invite bold ideas. Deloitte1 is proud to 
answer your call, drawing on decades of experience helping guide  federal and state health agencies, 
payers, providers, and accountable care organizations  (ACOs ) through the evolving health 
technology landscape . Below, we offer perspectives on short - and long -term opportunities for the 
government to rapidly accelerate interoperability improvements  to equip providers with better, 
more actionable information on their patients and shift  the national healthcare landscape towards a 
focus on prevention and value.  
While the government has established a foundation for data exchange  through its interoperability  
rulemaking and electronic health record ( EHR) incentive payment and certification programs , the 
actual use and scope of interoperable solutions and data is still limited . We believe these efforts can 
be rapidly expanded and accelerated through:

Background  
 
 NielsenIQ (NIQ) is the global leader in consumer product market measurement, 
founded in 1923 by Arthur C. Nielsen, and continually evolving to capture the Full View 
of consumer buying behavior . NIQ solutions include POS sales data and consumer 
panel data for both instore and online purchases of categories such as food, beverage, 
tobacco, alcohol, over -the-counter (OTC) medication, personal care and more. In 
addition, NIQ captures product attribution  information for all items across the grocery 
store including nutrient, ingredient and marketing claims.

National Interoperability Acceleration Framework
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I urge CMS to prioritize not only standards adoption but also implementation capacity across the health IT ecosystem. Interoperability cannot succeed without aligned programs that support real-world uptake. I offer the following recommendations:
1. Launch CMS-Sponsored FHIR Hackathons
CMS should partner with ONC, ASTP, and NLM to fund national and regional FHIR hackathons focused on:
•	Cancer, behavioral health, public health, and quality reporting (USCDI+ domains)
•	C-CDA to FHIR and CCD to IPS transformation
•	Advance directives and aging population use cases (e.g., Medicare, MA plans)
•	Emergency medicine, telehealth, and rural care delivery
These events can serve as real-time implementation labs to test standards, develop scalable tools, and build workforce experience.
2. Develop an Interoperability Workforce Pipeline
Create a national SME Registry in partnership with ONC, NLM, and ASTP to:
•	Recruit and credential experts in FHIR, SNOMED CT, LOINC, IPS, and openEHR
•	Align with accreditation bodies (e.g., CAHIIM) and offer microcredentials
•	Establish early career tracks for Master’s and PhD students in informatics, public health, and data science
This would address the national shortage of implementers and standards SMEs and ensure we can scale health IT innovation equitably.

NCQA recommends that CMS take a leadership role building trust, transparency and usability in 
the digital health ecosystem by promoting independent , third -party evaluation of digital health 
products. As digital tools become more central to how patients manage their health —particularly 
outside traditional clinical encounters —patients, caregivers and providers  will need to be able to  
identify the tools  that improve health outcomes and drive down health  care costs.  
To meet this need, NCQA is developing a program  that defines and evaluates high -quality digital 
condition management . Digital health products  are often asynchronous, app -based and patient -
directed , designed to support chronic condition management, behavioral health and preventive 
care. But the current ecosystem lacks consistent standards for evaluating their clinical rigor, 
usability and data exchange capabilities.

Our recommendations include revamping the Silver Sneakers program with modern AI tools and behavioral science insights to empower a more technologically savvy generation of seniors, and offering a CMS certification for the highest quality digital health apps. We also recommend expanding the definition of health data to include data on daily behaviors – and finding ways to combine or allow others to combine these data sources to improve care coordination and better understand the return on prevention. To increase technology adoption and innovation, we recommend creating new reimbursement pathways for providers, potential premium reductions/other incentives for beneficiaries and their caregivers, and streamlining regulatory approvals for app developers.

Introduction  
First, a brief introduction. Intermountain Health is the largest nonprofit health system in the 
Intermountain West. We operate 33 hospitals and 400 clinics while also serving more than 3 million 
Americans with our virtual hospital. We would like to thank C MS for the opportunity to comment on 
the state of healthcare data interoperability. Moreover, we would like to take this opportunity to:   
  
1. Take a step back to quickly review why we are still discussing how to solve a persistent problem 
that has plagued the industry for more than three decades;  
2. Identify the two key problems that must be solved before we unleash long overdue seamless 
digital and clinical innovations to improve patient safety, clinical quality, and affordability ; 
3. Present a viable path forward that follows the order of operations that led to solving similar 
challenges in banking and the internet; and  
4. Outline how CMS can support this open -sourced approach that will lay the critical foundation 
needed to finally solve healthcare’s data problems.

This request is for a radiology imaging interpretation app.

Patients could really use Cms&#039; help with obtaining accurate Cat scans, MRIs, other test interpretations. 

The reports are really inaccurate, omitting the findings I need noted to get medical treatment. 

Doctors often give the wrong reason for the test, so the test is set up wrong to address the fake symptoms, then the interpretation (if something is reported) aligns with the fake symptoms or reason, making it implausible or invalid. Doctors don&#039;t listen when you question this undermining practice. 

My family and I would love to have an AI radiology interpretation ap integrated with the rlectronic record alongside the hospital reading. It has to be stored together or it will be ignored by doctors. The app would allow me to enter my symptoms and describe abnormalities in detail, also compare with the most useful past tests, and list possible diagnoses. This would save a lot of money because it would help enable timely diagnosis, preventing chronic illness. It would also prevent repeated testing and unnecessary visits to the ER.

Thank you for your consideration.">Dear CMS,

transform the experience of care for Medicare beneficiaries and those who support them. At Fold Health, we see this moment 
as a call to reimagine not just the tools we build —but the relationships, workflows, and outcomes those tools are meant to 
enable.

I’m Max Doppelt, founder of Patient Data Vault. I started this company after helping my mother navigate a late-stage cancer diagnosis. Despite having access to excellent providers, we struggled to collect her records, find accurate clinical trial matches, and coordinate care across systems. We nearly missed a promising treatment because the data her doctors needed was locked in fragmented systems and inaccessible at the moment it mattered. That experience showed me the life-and-death consequences of poor interoperability, and the urgent need for digital tools built around patients, not systems.

Patient Data Vault is now a platform helping patients assemble longitudinal records, identify evidence-based care options such as clinical trials, and share outcomes with researchers. Informed by that experience, I respectfully submit the following comments.

The persistent failures of the past decade—the superficial adoption of standards, the entrenchment of data-hoarding business models, the stagnation of innovation, and the constrained potential of AI—are not incidental bugs in the system. They are predictable features of a market that structurally rewards the creation of data silos. Continuing down this path with more incremental rules and voluntary frameworks will only yield more of the same frustrating results.
A fundamental strategic pivot is required. The only viable path forward is for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, in its role as the nation&#039;s largest payer and most influential market actor, to lead the deliberate construction of a national health data infrastructure. This is not a call for more regulation in the traditional sense, but for the establishment of essential public utilities—the digital roads, registries, and common languages that a 21st-century healthcare system requires to function.
The 11-point blueprint detailed in this report provides a cohesive and actionable framework for building this infrastructure. By mandating FHIR as the universal standard for all data reporting, access, and quality measurement, CMS can create a powerful forcing function for data quality.

Our experience has shown that the United States has reached the limit of what a compliance-driven, market-led approach can achieve. The persistent failures superficial standards adoption, entrenched data-hoarding business models, and stagnant innovation are not incidental bugs. They are predictable features of a market that structurally rewards the creation of data silos.

A fundamental strategic pivot is required. This RFI presents a critical opportunity to move beyond incremental rules and toward the deliberate construction of a national health data infrastructure.
